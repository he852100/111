This cmdlet executes a specified script block on one or more remote machines. The expression or command, as they will be interchangeably called, need to be contained in a script block. This is to ensure two things: 1. The expression that the user has entered is syntactically correct (its compiled) 2. The scriptblock can be converted to a powershell object before transmitting it to the remote end so that it can be run on constrained runspaces in the no language mode In general, the command script block is executed as if the user had typed it at the command line. The output of the command is the output of the cmdlet. However, since invoke-command is a cmdlet, it will unravel its output: - if the command outputs an empty array, invoke-command will output $null - if the command outputs a single-element array, invoke-command will output that single element. Additionally, the command will be run on a remote system. This cmdlet can be called in the following different ways: Execute a command in a remote machine by specifying the command and machine name invoke-command -Command {get-process} -computername "server1" Execute a command in a set of remote machines by specifying the command and the list of machines $servers = 1..10 | ForEach-Object {"Server${_}"} invoke-command -command {get-process} -computername $servers Create a new runspace and use it to execute a command on a remote machine $runspace = New-PSSession -computername "Server1" $credential = get-credential "user01" invoke-command -command {get-process} -Session $runspace -credential $credential Execute a command in a set of remote machines by specifying the complete uri for the machines $uri = "http://hostedservices.microsoft.com/someservice" invoke-command -command { get-mail } - uri $uri Create a collection of runspaces and use it to execute a command on a set of remote machines $serveruris = 1..8 | ForEach-Object {"http://Server${_}/"} $runspaces = New-PSSession -URI $serveruris invoke-command -command {get-process} -Session $runspaces The cmdlet can also be invoked in the asynchronous mode. invoke-command -command {get-process} -computername $servers -asjob When the -AsJob switch is used, the cmdlet will emit an PSJob Object. The user can then use the other job cmdlets to work with this object Note there are two types of errors: 1. Remote invocation errors 2. Local errors. Both types of errors will be available when the user invokes a receive operation. The PSJob object has its own throttling mechanism. The result object will be stored in a global cache. If a user wants to retrieve data from the result object the user should be able to do so using the Receive-PSJob cmdlet The following needs to be noted about exception/error reporting in this cmdlet: The exception objects that are thrown by underlying layers will be written as errors, to avoid stopping the entire cmdlet in case of multi-computername or multi-Session usage (for consistency, this is true even when done using one computername or runspace) Only one expression may be executed at a time in any single runspace. Attempts to invoke an expression on a runspace that is already executing an expression shall return an error with ErrorCategory ResourceNotAvailable and notify the user that the runspace is currently busy. Some additional notes: - invoke-command issues a single scriptblock to the computer or runspace. If a runspace is specified and a command is already running in that runspace, then the second command will fail - The files necessary to execute the command (cmdlets, scripts, data files, etc) must be present on the remote system; the cmdlet is not responsible for copying them over - The entire input stream is collected and sent to the remote system before execution of the command begins (no input streaming) - Input shall be available as $input.  Remote Runspaces must reference $input explicitly (input will not automatically be available) - Output from the command streams back to the client as it is available - Ctrl-C and pause/resume are supported; the client will send a message to the remote powershell instance. - By default if no -credential is specified, the host will impersonate the current user on the client when executing the command - The standard output of invoke-command is the output of the last element of the remote pipeline, with some extra properties added - If -Shell is not specified, then the value of the environment variable DEFAULTREMOTESHELLNAME is used. If this is not set, then "Microsoft.PowerShell" is used.
Monad help is an architecture made up of three layers: 1. At the top is get-help commandlet from where help functionality is accessed. 2. At the middle is the help system which collects help objects based on user's request. 3. At the bottom are different help providers which provide help contents for different kinds of information requested. Class HelpSystem implements the middle layer of Monad Help. HelpSystem will provide functionalitys in following areas, 1. Initialization and management of help providers 2. Help engine: this will invoke different providers based on user's request. 3. Help API: this is the API HelpSystem provide to get-help commandlet. Initialization: Initialization of different help providers needs some context information like "ExecutionContext" Help engine: By default, HelpInfo will be retrieved in two phase: exact-match phase and search phase. Exact-match phase: help providers will be called in appropriate order to retrieve HelpInfo. If a match is found, help engine will stop and return the one and only HelpInfo retrieved. Search phase: all relevant help providers will be called to retrieve HelpInfo. (Order doesn't matter in this case) Help engine will not stop until all help providers are called. Behaviour of help engine can be modified based on Help API parameters in following ways, 1. limit the number of HelpInfo to be returned. 2. specify which providers will be used. 3. general help info returned in case the search target is empty. 4. default help info (or hint) returned in case no match is found. Help Api: Help Api is the function to be called by get-help commandlet. Following information needs to be provided in Help Api parameters, 1. search target: (which can be one or multiple strings) 2. help type: limit the type of help to be searched. 3. included fields: the fields to be included in the help info 4. excluded fields: the fields to be excluded in the help info 5. max number of results to be returned: 6. scoring algorithm for help results? 7. help reason: help can be directly invoked by end user or as a result of some command syntax error. [gxie, 7-25-04]: included fields, excluded fields and help reason will be handled in get-help commandlet. Help API's are internal. The only way to access help is by invoking the get-help command. To support the scenario where multiple monad engine running in one process. It is required that each monad engine has its one help system instance. Currently each ExecutionContext has a help system instance as its member. Help Providers: The basic contract for help providers is to provide help based on the search target. The result of help provider invocation can be three things: a. Full help info. (in the case of exact-match and single search result) b. Short help info. (in the case of multiple search result) c. Partial help info. (in the case of some commandlet help info, which should be supplemented by provider help info) d. Help forwarding info. (in the case of alias, which will change the target for alias) Help providers may need to provide functionality in following two area, a. caching and indexing to boost performance b. localization.
Convert an xmlNode into an PSObject. There are four scenarios, 1. Null xml, this will return an PSObject wrapping a null object. 2. Atomic xml, which is an xmlNode with only one simple text child node <atomicXml attribute="value"> atomic xml text </atomicXml> In this case, an PSObject that wraps string "atomic xml text" will be returned with following properties attribute =&gt; name 3. Composite xml, which is an xmlNode with structured child nodes, but not a special case for Maml formating. <compositeXml attribute="attribute"><singleChildNode> single child node text </singleChildNode><dupChildNode> dup child node text 1 </dupChildNode><dupChildNode> dup child node text 2 </dupChildNode></compositeXml> In this case, an PSObject will base generated based on an inside PSObject, which in turn has following properties a. property "singleChildNode", with its value an PSObject wrapping string "single child node text" b. property "dupChildNode", with its value an PSObject array wrapping strings for two dupChildNode's The outside PSObject will have property, a. property "attribute", with its value an PSObject wrapping string "attribute" 4. Maml formatting xml, this is a special case for Composite xml, for example <description attribute="value"><para> para 1 </para><list><listItem><para> list item 1 </para></listItem><listItem><para> list item 2 </para></listItem></list><definitionList><definitionListItem><term> term 1 </term><definition> definition list item 1 </definition></definitionListItem><definitionListItem><term> term 2 </term><definition> definition list item 2 </definition></definitionListItem></definitionList></description> In this case, an PSObject based on an PSObject array will be created. The inside PSObject array will contain following items . a MamlParaTextItem based on "para 1" . a MamlUnorderedListItem based on "list item 1" . a MamlUnorderedListItem based on "list item 2" . a MamlDefinitionListItem based on "definition list item 1" . a MamlDefinitionListItem based on "definition list item 2" The outside PSObject will have a property attribute =&gt; "value"
Monad Logging in general is a two layer architecture. At the upper layer are the Msh Log Engine and Logging Api. At the lower layer is the Provider Interface and Log Providers. This architecture is adopted to achieve independency between Monad logging and logging details of different logging technology. This file implements the upper layer of the Monad Logging architecture. Lower layer of Msh Log architecture is implemented in LogProvider.cs file. Logging Api is made up of following five sets 1. Engine Health Event 2. Engine Lifecycle Event 3. Command Lifecycle Event 4. Provider Lifecycle Event 5. Settings Event Msh Log Engine provides features in following areas, 1. Loading and managing logging providers. Based on some "Provider Catalog", engine will try to load providers. First provider that is successfully loaded will be used for low level logging. If no providers can be loaded, a dummy provider will be used, which will essentially do nothing. 2. Implementation of logging api functions. These api functions is implemented by calling corresponding functions in provider interface. 3. Sequence Id Generation. Unique id are generated in this class. These id's will be attached to events. 4. Monad engine state management. Engine state is stored in ExecutionContext class but managed here. Later on, this feature may be moved to engine itself (where it should belongs to) when sophisticated engine state model is established. 5. Logging policy support. Events are logged or not logged based on logging policy settings (which is stored in session state of the engine. MshLog class is defined as a static class. This essentially make the logging api to be a static api. We want to provide sufficient synchronization for static functions calls. This is not needed for now because of following two reasons, a. Currently, only one monad engine can be running in one process. So logically only one event will be log at a time. b. Even in the case of multiple events are logged, underlining logging media should provide synchronization.
Defines the authorization policy that controls the way scripts (and other command types) are handled by Monad.  This authorization policy enforces one of four levels, as defined by the 'ExecutionPolicy' value in one of the following locations: In priority-order (highest priority first,) these come from: - Machine-wide Group Policy HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell - Current-user Group Policy HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell. - Current session preference ENV:PSExecutionPolicyPreference - Current user machine preference HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShell\1\ShellIds\Microsoft.PowerShell - Local machine preference HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShell\1\ShellIds\Microsoft.PowerShell Restricted - All .ps1 files are blocked.  ps1xml files must be digitally signed, and by a trusted publisher.  If you haven't made a trust decision on the publisher yet, prompting is done as in AllSigned mode. AllSigned - All .ps1 and .ps1xml files must be digitally signed.  If signed and executed, Monad prompts to determine if files from the signing publisher should be run or not. RemoteSigned - Only .ps1 and .ps1xml files originating from the internet must be digitally signed.  If remote, signed, and executed, Monad prompts to determine if files from the signing publisher should be run or not.  This is the default setting. Unrestricted - No files must be signed.  If a file originates from the internet, Monad provides a warning prompt to alert the user.  To suppress this warning message, right-click on the file in File Explorer, select "Properties," and then "Unblock."  Requires Shell. Bypass - No files must be signed, and internet origin is not verified.
Returns the context cached ModuleTable module for import only if found and has safe language boundaries while exporting all functions by default. This protects cached trusted modules that exported all functions in a trusted context, from being re-used in an untrusted context and thus exposing functions that were meant to be private in that context. Returning false forces module import to re-import the module from file with the current context and prevent all module functions from being exported by default. Note that module loading order is important with this check when the system is *locked down with DeviceGuard*. If a submodule that does not explicitly export any functions is imported from the command line, its useless because no functions are exported (default fn export is explictly disallowed on locked down systems). But if a parentmodule that imports the submodule is then imported, it will get the useless version of the module from the ModuleTable and the parent module will not work. $mSub = import-module SubModule  # No functions exported, useless $mParent = import-module ParentModule  # This internally imports SubModule $mParent.DoSomething  # This will likely be broken because SubModule functions are not accessible But this is not a realistic scenario because SubModule is useless with DeviceGuard lock down and must explicitly export its functions to become useful, at which point this check is no longer in effect and there is no issue. $mSub = import-module SubModule  # Explictly exports functions, useful $mParent = import-module ParentModule  # This internally imports SubModule $mParent.DoSomething  # This works because SubModule functions are exported and accessible.
The GroupPolicy related settings used in PowerShell are as follows in Registry: - Software\Policies\Microsoft\PowerShellCore -- { EnableScripts (0 or 1); ExecutionPolicy (string) } SubKeys Name-Value-Pairs - ScriptBlockLogging { EnableScriptBlockLogging (0 or 1); EnableScriptBlockInvocationLogging (0 or 1) } - ModuleLogging { EnableModuleLogging (0 or 1); ModuleNames (string[]) } - Transcription { EnableTranscripting (0 or 1); OutputDirectory (string); EnableInvocationHeader (0 or 1) } - UpdatableHelp { DefaultSourcePath (string) } - ConsoleSessionConfiguration { EnableConsoleSessionConfiguration (0 or 1); ConsoleSessionConfigurationName (string) } - Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\EventLog SubKeys Name-Value-Pairs - ProtectedEventLogging  { EnableProtectedEventLogging (0 or 1); EncryptionCertificate (string[]) } The JSON representation is in sync with the 'PowerShellPolicies' type. Here is an example: { "PowerShellPolicies": { "ScriptExecution": { "ExecutionPolicy": "RemoteSigned" }, "ScriptBlockLogging": { "EnableScriptBlockInvocationLogging": true, "EnableScriptBlockLogging": false }, "ProtectedEventLogging": { "EnableProtectedEventLogging": false, "EncryptionCertificate": [ "Joe" ] }, "Transcription": { "EnableTranscripting": true, "EnableInvocationHeader": true, "OutputDirectory": "c:\\tmp" }, "UpdatableHelp": { "DefaultSourcePath": "f:\\temp" }, "ConsoleSessionConfiguration": { "EnableConsoleSessionConfiguration": true, "ConsoleSessionConfigurationName": "name" } } }
MamlNode is an xml node in MAML schema. Maml schema includes formatting oriented tags like para, list etc, which needs to be taken care of during display. As a result, xml node in Maml schema can't be converted into PSObject directly with XmlNodeAdapter. MamlNode class provides logic in converting formatting tags into the format acceptable by monad format and output engine. Following three kinds of formating tags are supported per our agreement with Maml team, 1. para, <para> para text here </para> 2. list, <list class="ordered|unordered"><listItem><para> listItem Text here </para></listItem></list> 3. definition list, <definitionList><definitionListItem><term> definition term text here </term><definition><para> definition text here </para></definition></definitionListItem></definitionList> After processing, content of these three tags will be converted into textItem and its derivations, 1. para =&gt; paraTextItem <textItem class="paraTextItem"><text>para text here</text></textItem> 2. list =&gt; a list of listTextItem's (which can be ordered or unordered) <textItem class="unorderedListTextItem"><tag>*</tag><text>text for list item 1</text></textItem><textItem class="unorderedListTextItem"><tag>*</tag><text>text for list item 2</text></textItem> 3. definitionList =&gt; a list of definitionTextItem's <definitionListItem><term>definition term here</term><definition>definition text here</definition></definitionListItem>
This cmdlet establishes a new Runspace either on the local machine or on the specified remote machine(s). The runspace established can be used to invoke expressions remotely. The cmdlet can be used in the following ways: Open a local runspace $rs = New-PSSession Open a runspace to a remote system. $rs = New-PSSession -Machine PowerShellWorld Create a runspace specifying that it is globally scoped. $global:rs = New-PSSession -Machine PowerShellWorld Create a collection of runspaces $runspaces = New-PSSession -Machine PowerShellWorld,PowerShellPublish,PowerShellRepo Create a set of Runspaces using the Secure Socket Layer by specifying the URI form. This assumes that an shell by the name of E12 exists on the remote server. $serverURIs = 1..8 | ForEach-Object { "SSL://server${_}:443/E12" } $rs = New-PSSession -URI $serverURIs Create a runspace by connecting to port 8081 on servers s1, s2 and s3 $rs = New-PSSession -computername s1,s2,s3 -port 8081 Create a runspace by connecting to port 443 using ssl on servers s1, s2 and s3 $rs = New-PSSession -computername s1,s2,s3 -port 443 -useSSL Create a runspace by connecting to port 8081 on server s1 and run shell named E12. This assumes that a shell by the name E12 exists on the remote server $rs = New-PSSession -computername s1 -port 8061 -ShellName E12.
This method generate a binary encoding of the FragmentedRemoteObject as follows: ObjectId: 8 bytes as long, byte order is big-endian. this value can only be non-negative. FragmentId: 8 bytes as long, byte order is big-endian. this value can only be non-negative. FlagsByte: 1 byte: 0x1 if IsStartOfFragment is true: This is called S-flag. 0x2 if IsEndOfFragment is true: This is called the E-flag. 0x4 if IsControl is true: This is called the C-flag. The other bits are reserved for future use. Now they must be zero when sending, and they are ignored when receiving. BlobLength: 4 bytes as int, byte order is big-endian. this value can only be non-negative.

Default behavior is to be consistent with the built-in cmdlets: - When a wildcard is specified, then no errors are reported (i.e. Get-Process -Name noSuchProcess*) - When no wildcard is specified, then errors are reported (i.e. Get-Process -Name noSuchProcess) Note that the following conventions are adopted: - Min/max queries (<see cref="M:Microsoft.PowerShell.Cmdletization.QueryBuilder.FilterByMinPropertyValue(System.String,System.Object,Microsoft.PowerShell.Cmdletization.BehaviorOnNoMatch)" /> and <see cref="M:Microsoft.PowerShell.Cmdletization.QueryBuilder.FilterByMaxPropertyValue(System.String,System.Object,Microsoft.PowerShell.Cmdletization.BehaviorOnNoMatch)" />) are treated as wildcards - Exclusions (<see cref="M:Microsoft.PowerShell.Cmdletization.QueryBuilder.ExcludeByProperty(System.String,System.Collections.IEnumerable,System.Boolean,Microsoft.PowerShell.Cmdletization.BehaviorOnNoMatch)" />) are treated as wildcards - Associations (<see cref="M:Microsoft.PowerShell.Cmdletization.QueryBuilder.FilterByAssociatedInstance(System.Object,System.String,System.String,System.String,Microsoft.PowerShell.Cmdletization.BehaviorOnNoMatch)" />) are treated as not a wildcard.
This instruction implements a goto expression that can jump out of any expression. It pops values (arguments) from the evaluation stack that the expression tree nodes in between the goto expression and the target label node pushed and not consumed yet. A goto expression can jump into a node that evaluates arguments only if it carries a value and jumps right after the first argument (the carried value will be used as the first argument). Goto can jump into an arbitrary child of a BlockExpression since the block doesn't accumulate values on evaluation stack as its child expressions are being evaluated. Goto needs to execute any finally blocks on the way to the target label. <example> { f(1, 2, try { g(3, 4, try { goto L } finally { ... }, 6) } finally { ... }, 7, 8) L: ... } </example> The goto expression here jumps to label L while having 4 items on evaluation stack (1, 2, 3 and 4). The jump needs to execute both finally blocks, the first one on stack level 4 the second one on stack level 2. So, it needs to jump the first finally block, pop 2 items from the stack, run second finally block and pop another 2 items from the stack and set instruction pointer to label L.
This class implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) to control the remote connection on the server side. There is a similar but not identical FSM on the client side for this connection. The FSM's states and events are defined to be the same for both the client FSM and the server FSM. This design allows the client and server FSM's to be as similar as possible, so that the complexity of maintaining them is minimized. This FSM only controls the remote connection state. States related to runspace and pipeline are managed by runspace pipeline themselves. This FSM defines an event handling matrix, which is filled by the event handlers. The state transitions can only be performed by these event handlers, which are private to this class. The event handling is done by a single thread, which makes this implementation solid and thread safe. This implementation of the FSM does not allow the remote session to be reused for a connection after it is been closed. This design decision is made to simplify the implementation. However, the design can be easily modified to allow the reuse of the remote session to reconnect after the connection is closed.

Cmdlet used for receiving results from job object. This cmdlet is intended to have a slightly different behavior in the following two cases: 1. The job object to receive results from is a PSRemotingJob In this case, the cmdlet can use two additional parameters to filter results - ComputerName and Runspace The parameters help filter out results for a specified computer or runspace from the job object $job = Start-PSJob -Command 'get-process' -ComputerName server1, server2 Receive-PSJob -Job $job -ComputerName server1 $job = Start-PSJob -Command 'get-process' -Session $r1, $r2 Receive-PSJob -Job $job -Session $r1 2. The job object to receive results is a PSJob (or derivative other than PSRemotingJob) In this case, the user cannot will use the location parameter to do any filtering and will not have ComputerName and Runspace parameters $job = Get-WMIObject '....' -AsJob Receive-PSJob -Job $job -Location "Server2" The following will result in an error: $job = Get-WMIObject '....' -AsJob Receive-PSJob -Job $job -ComputerName "Server2" The parameter ComputerName cannot be used with jobs which are not PSRemotingJob.
Subscribes to an event on an object. <param name="source"> The source object that defines the event </param><param name="eventName"> The event to subscribe </param><param name="sourceIdentifier"> An optional subscription identifier to help identify this event subscription </param><param name="data"> Any additional data you wish to attach to the event </param><param name="handlerDelegate"> Any action to be invoked when the event arrives </param><param name="supportEvent"> Any action to be invoked when the event arrives </param><param name="forwardEvent"> Whether events in this subscriber should be forwarded to the client PowerShell during remote executions </param><param name="shouldQueueAndProcessInExecutionThread"> True, if the handlerDelegate should be processed in the pipeline execution thread (if possible). </param><param name="maxTriggerCount"> Indicate how many times the subscriber should be triggered before auto-unregister it If the value is equal or less than zero, there is no limit on the number of times the event can be triggered without being unregistered The default value is zero </param>
Returns a dictionary from a command name to <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.CommandMetadata" /> describing how that command can be restricted to limit attack surface while still being usable by features included in <paramref name="sessionCapabilities" />. For example the implicit remoting feature (included in <see cref="F:System.Management.Automation.SessionCapabilities.RemoteServer" />) doesn't use all parameters of Get-Help and uses only a limited set of argument values for the parameters it does use. <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.CommandMetadata" /> can be passed to <see cref="M:System.Management.Automation.ProxyCommand.Create(System.Management.Automation.CommandMetadata)" /> method to generate a body of a proxy function that forwards calls to the actual cmdlet, while exposing only the parameters listed in <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.CommandMetadata" />.  Exposing only the restricted proxy function while making the actual cmdlet and its aliases private can help in reducing attack surface of the remoting server.
This is for adding a property into a property hashtable. As mentioned in comment of GetInsideProperties, property values stored in property hashtable is an array to begin with. The property value to be added is an mshObject whose base object can be an PSObject array itself. In that case, each PSObject in the array will be added separately into the property value array. This case can only happen when an node with maml formatting node inside is treated. The side effect of this is that the properties for outside mshObject will be lost. An example of this is that, <command><description attrib1="value1"><para></para><list></list><definitionList></definitionList></description></command> After the processing, PSObject corresponding to command will have an property with name "description" and a value of an PSObject array created based on maml formatting node inside "description" node. The attribute of description node "attrib1" will be lost. This seems to be OK with current practice of authoring monad command help.
If this flag is true, the commands in this Pipeline will redirect the global error output pipe (ExecutionContext.ShellFunctionErrorOutputPipe) to the command's error output pipe. When the global error output pipe is not set, $ErrorActionPreference is not checked and all errors are treated as terminating errors. On V1, the global error output pipe is redirected to the command's error output pipe only when it has already been redirected. The command-line host achieves this redirection by merging the error output into the output pipe so it checks $ErrorActionPreference all right. However, when the Pipeline class is used programmatically the global error output pipe is not set and the first error terminates the pipeline. This flag is used to force the redirection. By default it is false to maintain compatibility with V1, but the V2 hosting interface (PowerShell class) sets this flag to true to ensure the global error output pipe is always set and $ErrorActionPreference when invoking the Pipeline.
Class which handles the throttling operations. This class is singleton and therefore when used either across cmdlets or at the infrastructure level it will ensure that there aren't more operations by way of accumulation than what is intended by design. This class contains a queue of items, each of which has the <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.Remoting.IThrottleOperation"> IThrottleOperation</see> interface implemented. To begin with THROTTLE_LIMIT number of items will be taken from the queue and the operations on them will be executed. Subsequently, as and when operations complete, new items from the queue will be taken and their operations executed. Whenever a consumer submits or adds operations, the methods will start as much operations from the queue as permitted based on the throttle limit. Also the event handler will start an operation once a previous event is completed. The queue used is a generic queue of type IThrottleOperations, as it will offer better performance.

This cmdlet is used to retrieve runspaces from the global cache and write it to the pipeline. The runspaces are wrapped and returned as PSSession objects. The cmdlet can be used in the following ways: List all the available runspaces get-pssession Get the PSSession from session name get-pssession -Name sessionName Get the PSSession for the specified ID get-pssession -Id sessionId Get the PSSession for the specified instance Guid get-pssession -InstanceId sessionGuid Get PSSessions from remote computer.  Optionally filter on state, session instanceid or session name. get-psession -ComputerName computerName -StateFilter Disconnected Get PSSessions from virtual machine. Optionally filter on state, session instanceid or session name. get-psession -VMName vmName -Name sessionName Get PSSessions from container. Optionally filter on state, session instanceid or session name. get-psession -ContainerId containerId -InstanceId instanceId.
Completion function used by all Shell functions. Returns error-&gt;code != 0 upon error; use error-&gt;errorDetail structure for extended error informations; the callback is called for each shell operation; after a WSManReceiveShellOutput operation is initiated, the callback is called for each output stream element or if error; the underlying implementation handles the polling of stream data from the command or shell. If WSMAN_COMMAND_STATE_DONE state is received, no more streams will be received from the command, so the command can be closed using WSManCloseShellOperationEx(command). If error-&gt;code != 0, the result is guaranteed to be NULL. The error and result objects are allocated and owned by the WSMan client stack; they are valid during the callback only; the user has to synchronously copy the data in the callback. This callback function will use the current access token, whether it is a process or impersonation token.

Convert an xmlNode containing maml formatting nodes into an PSObject array. For example, for node, <description attribute="value"><para> para 1 </para><list><listItem><para> list item 1 </para></listItem><listItem><para> list item 2 </para></listItem></list><definitionList><definitionListItem><term> term 1 </term><definition> definition list item 1 </definition></definitionListItem><definitionListItem><term> term 2 </term><definition> definition list item 2 </definition></definitionListItem></definitionList></description> In this case, an PSObject based on an PSObject array will be created. The inside PSObject array will contain following items . a MamlParaTextItem based on "para 1" . a MamlUnorderedListItem based on "list item 1" . a MamlUnorderedListItem based on "list item 2" . a MamlDefinitionListItem based on "definition list item 1" . a MamlDefinitionListItem based on "definition list item 2"
This is for getting inside properties of an XmlNode. Properties are stored in a hashtable with key as property name and value as property value. Inside node with same node names will be grouped into one property with property value as an array. For example, for xmlNode like, <command><name>get-item</name><note>note 1</note><note>note 2</note></command> It will create an PSObject based on null, with following two properties . property 1: name="name" value=an PSObject to wrap string "get-item" . property 2: name="note" value=an PSObject array with following two PSObjects 1. PSObject wrapping string "note 1" 2. PSObject wrapping string "note 2" Since we don't know whether an node name will be used more than once, We are making each property value is an array (PSObject[]) to start with. At the end, SimplifyProperties will be called to reduce PSObject[] containing only one element to PSObject itself.
Class HelpProvider defines the interface to be implemented by help providers. Help Providers: The basic contract for help providers is to provide help based on the search target. The result of help provider invocation can be three things: a. Full help info. (in the case of exact-match and single search result) b. Short help info. (in the case of multiple search result) c. Partial help info. (in the case of some commandlet help info, which should be supplemented by provider help info) d. Help forwarding info. (in the case of alias, which will change the target for alias) Help providers may need to provide functionality in following two area, a. caching and indexing to boost performance b. localization Basic properties of a Help Provider 1. Name 2. Type 3. Assembly Help Provider Interface 1. Initialize: 2. ExactMatchHelp: 3. SearchHelp: 4. ProcessForwardedHelp.
HelpErrorTracer is a class to help tracing errors happened during loading help content for a help topic. This class tracks help context information like help topic, help category and help file, which are usually not available when an error happens at down level. Following is how this class can be used. using(HelpErrorTracer.Trace(helpTopic, helpCategory, helpFile)) { InsideFunctionCall(); } At this moment, a TraceFrame instance, which is disposable, will be created. In inside function calls and the calls down on the call stack, error can be traced by calling, HelpErrorTracer.TraceError(errorRecord) At this moment, the errorRecord will be temporarily stored with in TraceFrame instance. When the TraceFrame instance is disposed, all errorRecords stored will be dumped into HelpSystem.LastErrors with context information attached.
This class is solely used by PSObject to support .net member lookup for all the adapters except for dotNetInstanceAdapter, mshMemberSetAdapter and mshObjectAdapter. If the original adapter is not one of those, then .net members are also exposed on the PSObject. This will have the following effect: 1. Every adapted object like xml, wmi, adsi will show adapted members as well as .net members. 2. Users will not need to access PSBase to access original .net members. 3. This will fix v1.0 ADSI adapter where most of the complaints were about discovering original .net members. Use of this class will allow us to customize the ultimate .net member lookup. For example, XML adapter already exposes .net methods. Using this class you can choose exact .net adapter to support .net member lookup and avoid lookup duplication.
A COM object could be directly of the type 'System.__ComObject', or it could be a strongly typed RWC, whose specific type derives from 'System.__ComObject'. A strongly typed RWC can be created via the 'new' operation with a Primary Interop Assembly (PIA). For example, with the PIA 'Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel', you can write the following code: var excelApp = new Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Application(); Type type = excelApp.GetType(); Type comObjectType = typeof(object).Assembly.GetType("System.__ComObject"); Console.WriteLine("excelApp type: {0}", type.FullName); Console.WriteLine("Is __ComObject assignable from? {0}", comObjectType.IsAssignableFrom(type)); and the results are: excelApp type: Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.ApplicationClass Is __ComObject assignable from? True.
Monad Logging in general is a two layer architecture. At the upper layer are the Msh Log Engine and Logging Api. At the lower layer is the Provider Interface and Log Providers. This architecture is adopted to achieve independency between Monad logging and logging details of different logging technology. This file implements the lower layer of the Monad Logging architecture. Upper layer of Msh Log architecture is implemented in MshLog.cs file. This class defines the provider interface to be implemented by each providers. Provider Interface. Corresponding to 5 categories of logging api interface, provider interface provides functions for logging a. EngineHealthEvent b. EngineLifecycleEvent c. CommandLifecycleEvent d. ProviderLifecycleEvent e. SettingsEvent.
Child job can call <see cref="M:System.Management.Automation.ThrottlingJob.AddChildJobWithoutBlocking(System.Management.Automation.StartableJob,System.Management.Automation.ThrottlingJob.ChildJobFlags,System.Action)" /> method or <see cref="M:System.Management.Automation.ThrottlingJob.AddChildJobAndPotentiallyBlock(System.Management.Automation.StartableJob,System.Management.Automation.ThrottlingJob.ChildJobFlags)" /> or <see cref="M:System.Management.Automation.ThrottlingJob.AddChildJobAndPotentiallyBlock(System.Management.Automation.Cmdlet,System.Management.Automation.StartableJob,System.Management.Automation.ThrottlingJob.ChildJobFlags)" /> method of the <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.ThrottlingJob" /> instance it belongs to.
Every Runspace in one process contains SessionStateInternal per module (module SessionState). Every RuntimeType is associated to only one SessionState in the Runspace, which creates it: it's ever global state or a module state. In the former case, module can be imported from the different runspaces in the same process. And so runspaces will share RuntimeType. But in every runspace, Type is associated with just one SessionState. We want type methods to be able access $script: variables and module-specific methods. To achieve it, we preserve reference to SessionState that creates type in the private field 'SessionStateFieldName'. Later, we use it to call scriptBlocks captured in ScriptBlockMemberMethodWrapper with the right sessionState.
Base class providing information about the screen device capabilities and used to write the output strings to the text output device. Each device supported will have to derive from it. Examples of supported devices are: *   Screen Layout: it layers on top of Console and RawConsole *   File: it layers on top of a TextWriter *   In Memory text stream: it layers on top of an in memory buffer *   Printer: it layers on top of a memory buffer then sent to a printer device Assumptions: - Fixed pitch font: layout done in terms of character cells - character cell layout not affected by bold, reverse screen, color, etc. - returned values might change from call to call if the specific underlying implementation allows window resizing.
Private data to be used by applications built on top of PowerShell. Local runspace pool is created with application private data set to an empty <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.PSPrimitiveDictionary" />. Remote runspace pool gets its application private data from the server (when creating the remote runspace pool) Calling this method on a remote runspace pool will block until the data is received from the server. The server will send application private data before reaching <see cref="F:System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.RunspacePoolState.Opened" /> state. Runspaces that are part of a <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.RunspacePool" /> inherit application private data from the pool.
TraceFrame class track basic context information for current help activity. TraceFrame instance exists in a scope governed by using statement. It is possible that a new TraceFrame instance will be created in the scope of another TraceFrame instance. The scopes of various live TraceFrame instances form a stack which is similar to call stacks of normal C# functions. This is why we call this class a "TraceFrame" TraceFrame itself implements IDisposable interface to guarantee a chance to write errors into system error pool when execution gets out of its scope. During disposal time, errorRecords accumulated will be written to system error pool together with error context information collected at instance creation.
Add types to the current scope. This method called at runtime after types are created at compile time. This method should be called for every ScriptBlockAst that defines types. I.e. class C1 {} function foo { class C2 {} } 1..10 | ForEach-Object { foo } DefinePowerShellTypes() would be called for two TypeDefinitionAsts at the same time and Types for C1 and C2 would be created at the same assembly. AddPowerShellTypesToTheScope() would be called for root script first and then for foo\C2, once we call function foo. Note that AddPowerShellTypesToTheScope() would be call on every foo call, 10 times. This method also should be called for 'using module' statements. Then added types would have a different name.
Safely retrieves the MainModule property of a process. Version 2.0 and below of the .NET Framework are impacted by a Win32 API usability knot that throws an exception if API tries to enumerate the process' modules while it is still loading them. This generates the error message: Only part of a ReadProcessMemory or WriteProcessMemory request was completed. The BCL fix in V3 was to just try more, so we do the same thing. Note: If you attempt to retrieve the MainModule of a 64-bit process from a WOW64 (32-bit) process, the Win32 API has a fatal flaw that causes this to return the same error. If you need the MainModule of a 64-bit process from a WOW64 process, you will need to write the P/Invoke yourself.
Private data to be used by applications built on top of PowerShell. Local runspace is created with application private data set to an empty <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.PSPrimitiveDictionary" />. Remote runspace gets its application private data from the server (set when creating a remote runspace pool) Calling this method on a remote runspace will block until the data is received from the server. The server will send application private data before reaching <see cref="F:System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.RunspacePoolState.Opened" /> state. Runspaces that are part of a <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.RunspacePool" /> inherit application private data from the pool.
This method should handle the situation when a stop signal is sent for this operation. For instance, when trying to open a set of remote runspaces, the user might hit ctrl-C. In which case, the pending runspaces to be opened will actually be signalled through this method to stop operation and return back. This method also needs to be asynchronous. Once an event is successfully received as a result of this function, the handler has to ensure that it raises an OperationComplete event with StopComplete for the throttle manager to handle. It is important that this function does not raise a StartComplete which will then result in the ThrottleComplete event not being raised by the throttle manager.
If a managed dll has native dependencies the handler will try to find these native dlls. 1. Gets the managed.dll location (folder) 2. Based on OS name and architecture name builds subfolder name where it is expected the native dll resides: 3. Loads the native dll managed.dll folder | |--- 'win-x64' subfolder | |--- native.dll | |--- 'win-x86' subfolder | |--- native.dll | |--- 'win-arm' subfolder | |--- native.dll | |--- 'win-arm64' subfolder | |--- native.dll | |--- 'linux-x64' subfolder | |--- native.so | |--- 'linux-x86' subfolder | |--- native.so | |--- 'linux-arm' subfolder | |--- native.so | |--- 'linux-arm64' subfolder | |--- native.so | |--- 'osx-x64' subfolder | |--- native.dylib
IInspectable represents the base interface for all WinRT types. Any run time class exposed through WInRT language projections like C#, VB.Net, C++ and JavaScript would have implemented the IInspectable interface. This interface is needed on long term basis to efficiently support identifying WinRT type instances created in Powershell session. Hence being included as part of SMA. The only purpose of this interface is to identify if the created object is of WinRT type. Users should not implement this interface for any custom functionalities. This is like a PInvoke. WinRT team have defined IInspectable in the COM layer. Through PInvoke this interface is being used in the managed layer.
Looks up a localized string similar to ExceptionClass=[ExceptionClass] ErrorCategory=[ErrorCategory] ErrorId=[ErrorId] ErrorMessage=[ErrorMessage] Severity=[Severity] SequenceNumber=[SequenceNumber] HostName=[HostName] HostVersion=[HostVersion] HostId=[HostId] HostApplication=[HostApplication] EngineVersion=[EngineVersion] RunspaceId=[RunspaceId] PipelineId=[PipelineId] CommandName=[CommandName] CommandType=[CommandType] ScriptName=[ScriptName] CommandPath=[CommandPath] CommandLine=[CommandLine] AdditionalInfo: Name=[AdditionalInfo_Name1];Value=[AdditionalInfo_Value1] Name=[AdditionalInfo_Name2];Value=[AdditionalInfo_Value2] Name=[AdditionalInfo_Name3];Value=[AdditionalInfo_Value3]
There should only be one instance of InternalHost per runspace (i.e. per engine), and all engine use of the host should be through that single instance.  If we ever accidentally create more than one instance of InternalHost per runspace, then some of the internal state checks that InternalHost makes, like checking the nestedPromptCounter, can be messed up. To ensure that this constraint is met, I wanted to make this class a singleton.  However, Hitesh rightly pointed out that a singleton would be appdomain-global, which would prevent having multiple runspaces per appdomain. So we will just have to be careful not to create extra instances of InternalHost per runspace.
New base class for a job that provides extended state management functionality on the job. Since the existing Job class is an abstract class and there are existing implementations of the same, it is required to have a new class that will have the extended functionality. This is to ensure that backwards compatibility is maintained However, this class will derive from the existing Job class. The option of deprecating the existing class was considered as well. In order to maintain backwards compatibility of PowerShell job cmdlets they will have to work with the old interface and hence deprecating the Job class did not add any benefit rather than deriving from the same.
Fast creation works if we have a known primitive types for the entire method signature.  If we have any non-primitive types then FastCreate falls back to SlowCreate which works for all types. Fast creation is fast because it avoids using reflection (MakeGenericType and Activator.CreateInstance) to create the types.  It does this through calling a series of generic methods picking up each strong type of the signature along the way.  When it runs out of types it news up the appropriate CallInstruction with the strong-types that have been built up. One relaxation is that for return types which are non-primitive types we can fallback to object due to relaxed delegates.
Subscribes to an event on an object. <param name="source"> The source object that defines the event </param><param name="eventName"> The event to subscribe </param><param name="sourceIdentifier"> An optional subscription identifier to help identify this event subscription </param><param name="data"> Any additional data you wish to attach to the event </param><param name="handlerDelegate"> Any action to be invoked when the event arrives </param><param name="supportEvent"> Any action to be invoked when the event arrives </param><param name="forwardEvent"> Whether events in this subscriber should be forwarded to the client PowerShell during remote executions </param>
By design, on the server side, each remote connection is represented by a ServerRemoteSession object, which contains one instance of this class. This class holds 4 pieces of information. 1. Client capability: This is the capability received during the negotiation process. 2. Server capability: This comes from default parameters. 3. Client configuration: This holds the remote session related configuration parameters that the client sent to the server. This parameters can be changed and resent after the connection is established. 4. Server configuration: this holds the server sider configuration parameters. All these together define the connection level parameters.

Looks up a localized string similar to Cannot serialize the credential. If this command is starting a workflow, the credentials cannot be persisted, because the process in which the workflow is started does not have permission to serialize credentials. -- If the workflow was started in a PSSession to the local computer, add the EnableNetworkAccess parameter to the command that created the session. -- If the workflow was started in a PSSession to a remote computer, add the Authentication parameter with a value of CredSSP to the command that created the session. Or, connect to a session configuration that has a RunAsUser property value.
Defines the base class for an authorization manager of a Runspace. An authorization manager helps a host control and restrict the execution of commands.  For each of the command types listed in the <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.CommandTypes" /> enumeration, the engine requests permission from the AuthorizationManager to run the command. Extending this class requires that you override the ShouldRun method with the logic specific to your needs.  The base class gives permission to run every command.  The default Microsoft.PowerShell.PSAuthorizationManager provides a customized and much more complete authorization policy.
Defines the ConfirmImpact levels.  These levels describe the "destructiveness" of an action, and thus the degree of important that the user confirm the action. For example, setting the read-only flag on a file might be Low, and reformatting a disk might be High. These levels are also used in $ConfirmPreference to describe which operations should be confirmed.  Operations with ConfirmImpact equal to or greater than $ConfirmPreference are confirmed. Operations with ConfirmImpact.None are never confirmed, and no operations are confirmed when $ConfirmPreference is ConfirmImpact.None (except when explicitly requested with -Confirm).
Get the text that represents this ParameterAst based on the $using variables passed in. A parameter name cannot be a using variable, but its default value could contain any number of UsingExpressions, for example: function bar ($x = (Get-X @using:defaultSettings.Parameters)) { ... } This method goes through the ParameterAst text and replace each $using variable with its new synthetic name (remove the $using prefix). This method is used when we call Invoke-Command targeting a PSv2 remote machine. In that case, we might need to call this method to process the script block text, since $using prefix cannot be recognized by PSv2.
This cmdlet takes a Job object and checks to see if it is debuggable.  If it is debuggable then it breaks into the job debugger in step mode.  If it is not debuggable then it is treated as a parent job and each child job is checked if it is debuggable and if it is will break into its job debugger in step mode. For multiple debuggable child jobs, each job execution will be halted and the debugger will step to each job execution point sequentially. When a job is debugged its output data is written to host and the executing job script will break into the host debugger, in step mode, at the next stoppable execution point.
The ranking of versions for comparison purposes (used in overload resolution.) A larger value means the conversion is better. Note that the lower nibble is all ones for named conversion ranks.  This allows for conversions with rankings in between the named values.  For example, int=&gt;string[] is value dependent, if the conversion from int=&gt;string succeeds, then an array is created, otherwise we try some other conversion.  The int=&gt;string[] conversion should be worse than int=&gt;string, but it is probably better than many other conversions, so we want it to be only slightly worse than int=&gt;string.
Provides an interface that allows simplified interaction with namespaces that support security descriptors. The methods on this interface allow a common set of commands to manage the security on any namespace that supports this interface. This interface should only be implemented on derived classes of <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.Provider.CmdletProvider" />, <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.Provider.ItemCmdletProvider" />, <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.Provider.ContainerCmdletProvider" />, or <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.Provider.NavigationCmdletProvider" />.
Helper method to invoke a PSCommand on a given runspace.  This method correctly invokes the command for these runspace cases: 1. Local runspace.  If the local runspace is busy it will invoke as a nested command. 2. Remote runspace. 3. Runspace that is stopped in the debugger at a breakpoint. Error and information streams are ignored and only the command result output is returned. This method is NOT thread safe.  It does not support running commands from different threads on the provided runspace.  It assumes the thread invoking this method is the same that runs all other commands on the provided runspace.
Represents a PowerShell command or script to execute against a Runspace(Pool) if provided, otherwise execute using a default Runspace. Provides access to different result buffers like output, error, debug, verbose, progress, warning, and information. Provides a simple interface to execute a powershell command: <code> Powershell.Create().AddScript("get-process").Invoke(); </code> The above statement creates a local runspace using default configuration, executes the command and then closes the runspace. Using RunspacePool property, the caller can provide the runspace where the command / script is executed.
Provides a thread-safe dictionary that maps call-ids to AsyncData objects. When a thread tries to do a get on a hashtable key (callId) that has not been set it is blocked. Once the key's value is set the thread is released. This is used to synchronize server calls with their responses. This code needs to be thread-safe. The locking convention is that only the internal or public methods use locks and are thread-safe. The private methods do not use locks and are not thread-safe (unless called by the internal and public methods). If the private methods becomes internal or public please review the locking.
This is the data dispatcher for the whole remote connection. This dispatcher is registered with the server side input queue's InputDataReady event. When the input queue has received data from client, it calls the InputDataReady listeners. This dispatcher distinguishes the negotiation packet as a special case. For all other data, it dispatches the data through Finite State Machines DoMessageReceived handler by raising the event MessageReceived. The FSM's DoMessageReceived handler further dispatches to the receiving components: such as runspace or pipeline which have their own data dispatching methods.
Gets the fragment or if no fragment is available registers the callback which gets called once a fragment is available. These 2 steps are performed in a synchronized way. While getting a fragment the following algorithm is used: 1. If this is the first time or if the last fragment read is an EndFragment, then a new set of fragments is chosen based on the implicit priority. PromptResponse is higher in priority order than default. 2. If last fragment read is not an EndFragment, then next fragment is chosen from the priority collection as the last fragment. This will ensure fragments are sent in order.
By default, wsman uses IEConfig - the current user Internet Explorer proxy settings for the current active network connection. This option requires the user profile to be loaded, so the option can be directly used when called within a process that is running under an interactive user account identity; if the client application is running under a user context different then the interactive user, the client application has to explicitly load the user profile prior to using this option. IMPORTANT: proxy configuration is supported for HTTPS only; for HTTP, the direct connection to the server is used.
This is for getting preformatted text from an xml document. Normally in xml document, preformatted text will be indented by a fix amount based on its position. The task of this function is to remove that fixed amount from the text. For example, in xml, <preformatted> void function() { // call some other function here; } </preformatted> we can find that the preformatted text are indented unanimously by 4 spaces because of its position in xml. After massaging in this function, the result text will be, void function { // call some other function here; } please notice that the indention is reduced.
NeedToLogEngineHealthEvent: check whether logging engine health event is necessary. Whether to log engine event is controled by session variable "LogEngineHealthEvent" The default value for this is true (?). Reading a session variable from execution context for every single logging call may be expensive. We may need to use a different approach for this: a. ExecutionContext will cache the value for variable "LogEngineHealthEvent" b. If this variable is changed, a notification function will change the cached value in engine correspondently. This applies to other logging preference variable also.
We need to add this built-in converter because in FullCLR, System.Uri has a TypeConverter attribute declared: [TypeConverter(typeof(UriTypeConverter))], so the conversion from 'string' to 'Uri' is actually taken care of by 'UriTypeConverter'. However, the type 'UriTypeConverter' is not available in CoreCLR, and thus the conversion from 'string' to 'Uri' would show a different behavior. Therefore, we just add this built-in string-to-uri converter using the same logic 'UriTypeConverter' is using in FullCLR, so the conversion behavior will be the same on desktop powershell and powershell core.
Looks up a localized string similar to Cannot invoke static methods or access static properties on the open generic type {0}.  Specify the type parameters and retry.  For example, instead of [System.Collections.Generic.HashSet``1]::CreateSetComparer() use [System.Collections.Generic.HashSet[int]]::CreateSetComparer(). Error message shown when somebody tries to access a property or invoke a static method on an uninstantiated generic type: PS&gt; [System.Collections.Generic.Comparer``1]::get_Default() {0} is a placeholder for a type name (for example: System.Collections.Generic.Comparer`1)
Helper to access Microsoft.PowerShell.GraphicalHost.dll (which references on WPF) using reflection, since we do not want System.Management.Automation.dll or Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility.dll to reference WPF. Microsoft.PowerShell.GraphicalHost.dll contains: 1) out-gridview window implementation (the actual cmdlet is in Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility.dll) 2) show-command window implementation (the actual cmdlet is in Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility.dll) 3) the help window used in the System.Management.Automation.dll's get-help cmdlet when -ShowWindow is specified.
Looks up a localized string similar to Cannot process the ObjectModelWrapper attribute. The {0} type defines the {1} cmdlet parameter with a {2} attribute parameter that is ignored.  Verify that the Cmdlet Definition XML specifies a valid type in the ObjectModelWrapper attribute and retry. {StrContains="ObjectModelWrapper"} {0} is a placeholder for a .NET class name.  Example: System.Net.IPAddress {1} is a placeholder for a cmdlet parameter name.  Example: 'ProcessId' {2} is a placeholder for a name of a property of ParameterAttribute class. Example: ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName
<para>Returns the name of the command invoked by this ast.</para><para>This command name may not be known statically, in which case null is returned.</para><para> For example, if the command name is in a variable: <example>&amp; $foo</example>, then the parser cannot know which command is executed. Similarly, if the command is being invoked in a module: <example>&amp; (gmo SomeModule) Bar</example>, then the parser does not know the command name is Bar because the parser can't determine that the expression <code>(gmo SomeModule)</code> returns a module instead of a string. </para>
The context of the core command that is being run. This includes data like the user name and password, as well as callbacks for streaming output, prompting, and progress. This allows the providers to be called in a variety of situations. The most common will be from the core cmdlets themselves but they can also be called programmatically either by having the results accumulated or by providing delegates for the various streams. NOTE:  USER Feedback mechanism are only enabled for the CoreCmdlet case.  This is because we have not seen a use-case for them in the other scenarios.
Gets the managed type that an object needs to be coverted to in order for it to be able to be represented as a Variant. In general, there is a many-to-many mapping between Type and VarEnum. However, this method returns a simple mapping that is needed for the current implementation. The reason for the many-to-many relation is: 1. Int32 maps to VT_I4 as well as VT_ERROR, and Decimal maps to VT_DECIMAL and VT_CY. However, this changes if you throw the wrapper types into the mix. 2. There is no Type to represent COM types. __ComObject is a private type, and Object is too general.
VerboseHelpErrors is used in the case when end user is interested to know all errors happened during a help search. This property is false by default. If this property is turned on (by setting session variable "VerboseHelpError"), following two behaviours will be different, a. Help errors will be written to error pipeline regardless the situation. (Normally, help errors will be written to error pipeline if there is no help found and there is no wildcard in help search target). b. Some additional warnings, including maml processing warnings, will be written to error pipeline.
Get inside PSObject created based on inside nodes of xmlNode. The inside PSObject will be based on null. It will created one property per inside node grouping by node names. For example, for xmlNode like, <command><name>get-item</name><note>note 1</note><note>note 2</note></command> It will create an PSObject based on null, with following two properties . property 1: name="name" value=an PSObject to wrap string "get-item" . property 2: name="note" value=an PSObject array with following two PSObjects 1. PSObject wrapping string "note 1" 2. PSObject wrapping string "note 2"
This method determines if the unbound mandatory parameters take pipeline input or if we can use the default parameter set.  If all the unbound mandatory parameters take pipeline input and the default parameter set is valid, then the default parameter set is set as the current parameter set and processing can continue.  If there are more than one valid parameter sets and the unbound mandatory parameters are not consistent across parameter sets or there is no default parameter set then a ParameterBindingException is thrown with an errorId of AmbiguousParameterSet.
Looks up a localized string similar to Disabling the session configurations does not undo all the changes made by the Enable-PSRemoting or Enable-PSSessionConfiguration cmdlet. You might have to manually undo the changes by following these steps: 1. Stop and disable the WinRM service. 2. Delete the listener that accepts requests on any IP address. 3. Disable the firewall exceptions for WS-Management communications. 4. Restore the value of the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy to 0, which restricts remote access to members of the Administrators group on the computer.
Set-StrictMode causes the interpreter to throw an exception in the following cases: * Referencing an unassigned variable * Referencing a non-existent property of an object * Calling a function as a method (with parentheses and commas) * Using the variable expansion syntax in a string literal w/o naming a variable, i.e. "${}" Parameters: -Version allows the script author to specify which strict mode version to enforce. -Off turns strict mode off Note: Unlike Set-PSDebug -strict, Set-StrictMode is not engine-wide, and only affects the scope it was defined in.
Looks up a localized string similar to The session {0} cannot be disconnected because the specified idle time-out value {1} (seconds) is either greater than the server maximum allowed {2} (seconds), or less than the minimum allowed {3} (seconds).  Specify an idle time-out value that is within the allowed range, and try again. {0} is a placeholder for the session name {1} is a placeholder for the provided idletimeout value {2} is a placeholder for the maximum allowed idletimeout value {3} is a placeholder for the minimum allowed idletimeout value
This class is used to hold a fragment of remoting PSObject for transporting to remote computer. A large remoting PSObject will be broken into fragments. Each fragment has a ObjectId and a FragmentId. The first fragment has a StartFragment marker. The last fragment also an EndFragment marker. These fragments can be reassembled on the receiving end by sequencing the fragment ids. Currently control objects (Control-C for stopping a pipeline execution) is not really fragmented. These objects are small. They are just wrapped into a single fragment.
This helper class contains a runspace and an associated pipeline. On StartOperation it calls OpenAsync on the runspace. In the handler for runspace, when the runspace is successfully opened it calls InvokeAsync on the pipeline. StartOperation is assumed complete when both the operations complete. StopOperation will call StopAsync first on the pipeline and then close the associated runspace. StopOperation is considered complete when both these operations complete. The handler sends a StopComplete message in OperationComplete for both the calls.
Writes a line to the "error display" of the host, as opposed to the "output display," which is written to by the variants of <seealso cref="M:System.Management.Automation.Host.PSHostUserInterface.Write(System.String)" /><seealso cref="M:System.Management.Automation.Host.PSHostUserInterface.Write(System.ConsoleColor,System.ConsoleColor,System.String)" /><seealso cref="M:System.Management.Automation.Host.PSHostUserInterface.WriteLine" /> and <seealso cref="M:System.Management.Automation.Host.PSHostUserInterface.WriteLine(System.String)" />
The default implementation writes a carriage return to the screen buffer. <seealso cref="M:System.Management.Automation.Host.PSHostUserInterface.Write(System.String)" /><seealso cref="M:System.Management.Automation.Host.PSHostUserInterface.Write(System.ConsoleColor,System.ConsoleColor,System.String)" /><seealso cref="M:System.Management.Automation.Host.PSHostUserInterface.WriteLine(System.String)" /><seealso cref="M:System.Management.Automation.Host.PSHostUserInterface.WriteLine(System.ConsoleColor,System.ConsoleColor,System.String)" />
Attempts to reconnect or connect to a running command on a remote server, which will resume events and data collection from the server. If connectCmdInfo parameter is null then a reconnection is attempted and it is assumed that the current client state is unchanged since disconnection. If connectCmdInfo parameter is non-null then a connection is attempted to the specified remote running command. This is an asynchronous call and results will be reported in the ReconnectCompleted or the ConnectCompleted call back as appropriate.
Each control (table, list, wide, or custom) may have multiple entries. If there are multiple entries, there must be a default entry with no condition, all other entries must have EntrySelectedBy specified. This is useful when you need a single view for grouping or otherwise just selecting the shape of formatting, but need distinct formatting rules for each instance.  For example, when listing files, you may want to group based on the parent path, but select different entries depending on if the item is a file or directory.
Looks up a localized string similar to ProviderName=[ProviderName] ExceptionClass=[ExceptionClass] ErrorCategory=[ErrorCategory] ErrorId=[ErrorId] ErrorMessage=[ErrorMessage] Severity=[Severity] SequenceNumber=[SequenceNumber] HostName=[HostName] HostVersion=[HostVersion] HostId=[HostId] HostApplication=[HostApplication] EngineVersion=[EngineVersion] RunspaceId=[RunspaceId] PipelineId=[PipelineId] CommandName=[CommandName] CommandType=[CommandType] ScriptName=[ScriptName] CommandPath=[CommandPath] CommandLine=[CommandLine]
Execute the accumulated commands and clear the pipeline. SynchronousExecute does not return until all commands have completed.  There is no asynchronous variant; instead, once the pipeline is set up, the caller can spawn a thread and call SynchronousExecute from that thread.  This does not mean that PipelineProcessor is thread-safe; once SynchronousExecute is running, PipelineProcessor should not be accessed through any other means. This variant of the routine looks at it's input object to see if it's enumerable or not.
Encodes and decodes data types and exceptions for transmission across the wire. Used for transmitting remote host method call parameters, return values, and exceptions. The convention is that EncodeObject converts the objects into a type that can be serialized and deserialized without losing fidelity. For example, EncodeObject converts Version objects to string, and converts more complex classes into property bags on PSObjects. This guarantees that transmitting on the wire will not change the encoded object's type.
Looks up a localized string similar to Memory usage of a cmdlet has exceeded a warning level. To avoid this situation, try one of the following: 1) Lower the rate at which CIM operations produce data (for example, by passing a low value to the ThrottleLimit parameter), 2) Increase the rate at which data is consumed by downstream cmdlets, or 3) Use the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run the whole pipeline on the server. The cmdlet that exceeded a warning level of memory usage was started by the following command line: {0}
The parameters specified immediately after the function name, or null if no parameters were specified. <para>It is possible that this property may have a value and <see cref="P:System.Management.Automation.Language.ScriptBlockAst.ParamBlock" /> to also have a value.  Normally this is not allowed in a valid script, but in one rare case it is allowed:</para><c>function foo() { param($a) }</c><para> In this example, the parameters specified after the function name must be empty or the script is not valid. </para>
The idea behind this class is: I should be able to re-use expensive type resolution operation result in the same context. Hence, this class is a key for TypeCache dictionary. Every SessionStateScope has TypeResolutionState. typesDefined contains PowerShell types names defined in the current scope and all scopes above. Same for namespaces. If TypeResolutionState doesn't add anything new compare to it's parent, we represent it as null. So, when we do lookup, we need to find first non-null TypeResolutionState.
Scan a string for suspicious content. This is based on the Rubin-Karp algorithm, but heavily modified to support searching for multiple patterns at the same time. The key difference from Rubin-Karp is that we don't undo the hash of the first character as we shift along in the input. Instead, we can rely on knowing we need the hashes for shorter strings anyway, so we reuse their values in computing the hash for the longer patterns. This lets us use a much simpler hash as well - we can avoid the use of mod.
Convert a list node into an PSObject array. For example, <list class="ordered"><listItem><para> text for list item 1 </para></listItem><listItem><para> text for list item 2 </para></listItem></list> In this case, an array of PSObject, each of type "MamlOrderedListText" will be created with following two properties, a. tag=" 1. " or " 2. " b. text="text for list item 1" or "text for list item 2" In the case of unordered list, similar PSObject will created with type to be "MamlUnorderedListText" and tag="*"
PSListModifier is a simple helper class created by the update-list cmdlet. The update-list cmdlet will either return an instance of this class, or it will internally use an instance of this class to implement the updates. Cmdlets can also take a PSListModifier as a parameter.  Usage might look like: Get-Mailbox | Set-Mailbox -Alias @{Add='jim'} Alias would take a PSListModifier and the Cmdlet code would be responsible for apply updates (possibly using PSListModifier.ApplyTo or else using custom logic).
The duration for which PowerShell should wait before it times out on cancel operations (close runspace or stop powershell). For instance, when the user hits ctrl-C, New-PSSession cmdlet tries to call a stop on all remote runspaces which are in the Opening state. The user wouldn't mind waiting for 15 seconds, but this should be time bound and of a shorter duration. A high timeout here like 3 minutes will give the user a feeling that the PowerShell client is not responding. Default: 60 * 1000 = 1 minute.
Use the Internet Explorer proxy configuration for the current user. Internet Explorer proxy settings for the current active network connection. This option requires the user profile to be loaded, so the option can be directly used when called within a process that is running under an interactive user account identity; if the client application is running under a user context different than the interactive user, the client application has to explicitly load the user profile prior to using this option.
Wraps PSHost instances to provide a shim layer between InternalCommand and the host-supplied PSHost instance. This class exists for the purpose of ensuring that an externally-supplied PSHost meets the minimum proper required implementation, and also to provide a leverage point at which the monad engine can hook the interaction between the engine, cmdlets, and that external host. That leverage may be necessary to manage concurrent access between multiple pipelines sharing the same instance of PSHost.
The duration (in ms) for which PowerShell should wait before it times out on cancel operations (close runspace or stop powershell). For instance, when the user hits ctrl-C, New-PSSession cmdlet tries to call a stop on all remote runspaces which are in the Opening state. The administrator wouldn't mind waiting for 15 seconds, but this should be time bound and of a shorter duration. A high timeout here like 3 minutes will give the administrator a feeling that the PowerShell client is not responding.
Describes whether the module was considered compatible at load time. Any module not on the System32 module path should have this as true. Modules loaded from the System32 module path will have this as true if they have declared edition compatibility with PowerShell 6+. Currently, this field is true for all non-psd1 module files, when it should not be. Being able to load psm1/dll modules from the System32 module path without needing to skip the edition check is considered a bug and should be fixed.
Registers a callback with WSMan to receive output from the remote end. If commandOperationHandle is null, then the receive callback is registered for shell. It is enough to register the callback only once. WSMan will keep on calling this callback as and when it has data for a particular command + shell. There will be only 1 callback active per command or per shell. So if there are multiple commands active, then there can be 1 callback active for each of them. TODO: How to unregister the callback.
Looks up a localized string similar to ExceptionClass=[ExceptionClass] ErrorCategory=[ErrorCategory] ErrorId=[ErrorId] ErrorMessage=[ErrorMessage] Severity=[Severity] SequenceNumber=[SequenceNumber] HostName=[HostName] HostVersion=[HostVersion] HostId=[HostId] HostApplication=[HostApplication] EngineVersion=[EngineVersion] RunspaceId=[RunspaceId] PipelineId=[PipelineId] CommandName=[CommandName] CommandType=[CommandType] ScriptName=[ScriptName] CommandPath=[CommandPath] CommandLine=[CommandLine]
When dotting a script, no new scope is created.  Automatic variables must go somewhere, so rather than store them in the scope they are dotted into, we just store them in a tuple like any other local variable so we can skip saving and restoring them as the scopes change, instead it's a simple push/pop of this stack. This works because in a dotted script block, the only locals in the tuple are the automatic variables, all other variables use the variable apis to find the variable and get/set it.
Process a helpinfo forwarded over by another help provider. HelpProvider can choose to process the helpInfo or not, 1. If a HelpProvider chooses not to process the helpInfo, it can return null to indicate helpInfo is not processed. 2. If a HelpProvider indeed processes the helpInfo, it should create a new helpInfo object instead of modifying the passed-in helpInfo object. This is very important since the helpInfo object passed in is usually stored in cache, which can used in later queries.
This binder is used to convert objects to string in specific circumstances, including: * The LHS of a format expression.  The arguments (the RHS objects) of the format expression are not converted to string here, that is defered to string.Format which may have some custom formatting to apply. * The objects passed to the format expression as part of an expandable string.  In this case, the format string is generated by the parser, so we know that there is no custom formatting to consider.
The following is the definition of the input parameter "ProxyAuthentication". This parameter takes a set of authentication methods the user can select from.  The available options should be as follows: - Negotiate: Use the default authentication (as defined by the underlying protocol) for establishing a remote connection. - Basic:  Use basic authentication for establishing a remote connection - Digest: Use Digest authentication for establishing a remote connection Default is Negotiate.
Creates a nested powershell within the current instance. Nested PowerShell is used to do simple operations like checking state of a variable while another command is using the runspace. Nested PowerShell should be invoked from the same thread as the parent PowerShell invocation thread. So effectively the parent Powershell invocation thread is blocked until nested invoke() operation is complete. Implement PSHost.EnterNestedPrompt to perform invoke() operation on the nested powershell.
Int (read only) - max data size (kb) provided by the client, guaranteed by the winrm client implementation to fit into one SOAP packet; this is an approximate value calculated based on the WSMAN_OPTION_MAX_ENVELOPE_SIZE_KB (default 150kb), the maximum possible size of the SOAP headers and the overhead of the base64 encoding which is specific to WSManSendShellInput API; this option can be used with WSManGetSessionOptionAsDword API; it cannot be used with WSManSetSessionOption API.
ExecutesConnect. expects client capability and connect_runspacepool PSRP messages in connectData. If negotiation is successful and max and min runspaces in connect_runspacepool match the associated runspace pool parameters, it builds up server capability and runspace_initinfo in connectResponseData. This is a version of Connect that executes the whole connect algorithm in one single hop. This algorithm is being executed synchronously without associating with state machine.
Looks up a localized string similar to Running command "{0}" to enable remote management of this computer by using the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service. This includes: 1. Starting or restarting (if already started) the WinRM service 2. Setting the WinRM service startup type to Automatic 3. Creating a listener to accept requests on any IP address 4. Enabling Windows Firewall inbound rule exceptions for WS-Management traffic (for http only). Do you want to continue?
Sending data to a remote command failed with the following error message: The client cannot connect to the destination specified in the request. Verify that the service on the destination is running and is accepting requests. Consult the logs and documentation for the WS-Management service running on the destination, most commonly IIS or WinRM. If the destination is the WinRM service, run the following command on the destination to analyze and configure the WinRM service:
If the throw statement is a rethrow.  In PowerShell, a throw statement need not throw anything.  Such a throw statement throws a new exception if it does not appear lexically withing a catch, otherwise it rethrows the caught exception.  Examples: <c> if ($true) { throw } # not a rethrow try { foo } catch { throw } # rethrow try { foo } catch { . { throw } } # rethrow try { foo } catch { function foo { throw } } # rethrow try { foo } finally { throw } # not a rethrow </c>
Retrieves all the members available in the object. The adapter implementation is encouraged to cache all properties/methods available in the first call to GetMember and GetMembers so that subsequent calls can use the cache. In the case of the .NET adapter that would be a cache from the .NET type to the public properties and fields available in that type. In the case of the DirectoryEntry adapter, this could be a cache of the objectClass to the properties available in it.
Represents module specification written in a module manifest (i.e. in RequiredModules member/field). Module manifest allows 2 forms of module specification: 1. string - module name 2. hashtable - [string]ModuleName (required) + [Version]ModuleVersion/RequiredVersion (required) + [Guid]GUID (optional) so we have a constructor that takes a string and a constructor that takes a hashtable (so that LanguagePrimitives.ConvertTo can cast a string or a hashtable to this type)
Looks up a localized string similar to Cannot process the ObjectModelWrapper attribute. The {0} type is not derived from the following class: {1}.  Verify that the Cmdlet Definition XML specifies a valid type in the ObjectModelWrapper attribute and retry. {StrContains="ObjectModelWrapper"} {0} is a placeholder for a .NET class name.  Example: System.Net.IPAddress {1} is a placeholder for a .NET class name. Example: Microsoft.PowerShell.Cmdletization.ObjectModelWrapper
This class is designed to be the server side controller of a remote connection. It contains a static entry point that the PowerShell server process will get into the server mode. At this entry point, a runspace configuration is passed in. This runspace configuration is used to instantiate a server side runspace. This class controls a remote connection by using a Session data structure handler, which in turn contains a Finite State Machine, and a transport mechanism.
BUGBUG - brucepay Mar. 2013 - I don't think this is general enough for dynamic keywords to support arbitrary target languages with arbitrary type representations so we may need an extension point here... Maps a .NET or CIM type name string (e.g. SInt32) to the form expected by PowerShell users, namely "[typename]" If there is no mapping, then it returns null. If the string to convert is null or empty then the function returns "[object]" as the default typeless type.
Closes a shell or a command; if the callback associated with the operation is pending and have not completed when WSManCloseShellOperationEx is called, the function waits for the callback to finish; If the operation was not finished, the operation is cancelled and the operation callback is called with WSMAN_ERROR_OPERATION_ABORTED error; then the WSManCloseShellOperationEx callback is called with WSMAN_FLAG_CALLBACK_END_OF_OPERATION flag as result of this operation.
The following is the definition of the input parameter "ProxyAuthentication". This parameter takes a set of authentication methods the user can select from.  The available options should be as follows: - Negotiate: Use the default authentication (ad defined by the underlying protocol) for establishing a remote connection. - Basic:  Use basic authentication for establishing a remote connection - Digest: Use Digest authentication for establishing a remote connection.
Event that is raised when a create operation on transport has been successfully completed The event is raised from a WSMan transport thread. Since this thread can hold on to a HTTP connection, the event handler should complete processing as fast as possible. Importantly the event handler should not generate any call that results in a user request like host.ReadLine(). Errors (occurred during connection attempt) are reported through WSManTransportErrorOccured event.
Used to retrieve helpinfo by removing the prefix from the noun portion of a command name. Import-Module and Import-PSSession supports changing the name of a command by suppling a custom prefix. In those cases, the help content is stored by using the original command name (without prefix) as the key. This method retrieves the help content by suppressing the prefix and then making a copy of the help content + change the name and then returns the copied help content.
Looks up a localized string similar to The value of the {0} key in {1} is {2} and the module has nested modules. When a CDXML file is the root module, the Import-Module command fails because the commands in nested modules cannot be exported. Move the CDXML file to the NestedModules key and try the command again. {0} is equal to either ModuleToProcess or RootModule {1} is a placeholder for a file path to psd1 file {2} is a placeholder for a file path to cdxml file
This cmdlet stops the runspace and frees the resources associated with that runspace. If any execution is in process in that runspace, it is stopped. Also, the runspace is removed from the global cache. This cmdlet can be used in the following ways: Remove the runspace specified $runspace = New-PSSession Remove-PSSession -remoterunspaceinfo $runspace Remove the runspace specified (no need for a parameter name) $runspace = New-PSSession Remove-PSSession $runspace.
Looks up a localized string similar to Cannot define the {0} parameter for the {1} cmdlet.  The parameter name is already defined by the {2} class.  Change the name of the parameter in Cmdlet Definition XML and retry. {0} is a placeholder for a cmdlet parameter name.  Example: 'ProcessId' {1} is a placeholder for a cmdlet name. Example: 'Get-Win32Process' {2} is a placeholder for a .NET class name.  Example: 'Microsoft.PowerShell.Cmdletization.Cim.CimWrapper'
Creates a new instance of the PsEventHandler class for a given event manager, source identifier, and extra data <param name="eventManager"> The event manager to which we forward events. </param><param name="sender"> The object that generated this event. </param><param name="sourceIdentifier"> An optional subscription identifier that identifies the source of the event </param><param name="extraData"> Any additional data you wish to attach to the event </param>
Helper method that escapes powershell parser recognized strings like "@{" from the error message string. This is needed to make error messages look authentic. Some WSMan error messages provide a command line to run to fix certain issues. WSMan command line has syntax that allows use of @{}. PowerShell parser treats them differently..and so when user cut and paste the command line in a PowerShell console, it wont work. This escape logic works around the issue.
Adds an argument to the last added command. For example, to construct a command string "get-process | select-object name" <code> PowerShell shell = PowerShell.Create("get-process"). AddCommand("select-object").AddParameter("name"); </code> This will add the value "name" to the positional parameter list of "select-object" cmdlet. When the command is invoked, this value will get bound to positional parameter 0 of the "select-object" cmdlet which is "Property".
Parse a dynamic keyword statement which will be either of the form keyword [parameters] [name] { a=1; b=2; } # constructor with properties or keyword [parameters] [name] { ... }  # constructor with a simple body. or keywordcommand parameters This custom keyword does not introduce a new AST node type. Instead it generates a CommandAst that calls a PowerShell command to implement the keyword's logic. This command has one of two signatures: keywordImplCommand.
Get help based on the target, help type, etc Help engine retrieve help based on following schemes, 1. if help target is empty, get default help 2. if help target is not a search pattern, try to retrieve exact help 3. if help target is a search pattern or step 2 returns no helpInfo, try to search for help (Search for pattern in command name followed by pattern match in help content) 4. if step 3 returns exact one helpInfo object, try to retrieve exact help.
Helper method to search for commands matching the provided commandPattern. Supports wild cards and if the commandPattern contains wildcard characters then multiple results can be returned.  Otherwise a single (and first) match will be returned. If a moduleName is provided then only commands associated with that module will be returned. Only public commands are searched to start with.  If no results are found then a search on internal commands is performed.
Adds an argument to the last added command. For example, to construct a command string "get-process | select-object name" <code> PSCommand command = new PSCommand("get-process"). AddCommand("select-object").AddParameter("name"); </code> This will add the value "name" to the positional parameter list of "select-object" cmdlet. When the command is invoked, this value will get bound to positional parameter 0 of the "select-object" cmdlet which is "Property".
Looks up a localized string similar to {0} may need to restart the WinRM service if a configuration using this name has recently been unregistered, certain system data structures may still be cached. In that case, a restart of WinRM may be required. All WinRM sessions connected to PowerShell session configurations, such as Microsoft.PowerShell and session configurations that are created with the Register-PSSessionConfiguration cmdlet, are disconnected.
Class that exposes read only properties and which conveys information about a remote runspace object to the user. The class serves the following purpose: 1. Exposes useful information to the user as properties 2. Shields the remote runspace object from directly being exposed to the user. This way, the user will not be able to directly act upon the object, but instead will have to use the remoting cmdlets. This will prevent any unpredictable behavior.
Class to manage the caching of analysis data. For performance, module command caching is flattened after discovery. Many modules have nested modules that can only be resolved at runtime - for example, script modules that declare: $env:PATH += "; $psScriptRoot". When doing initial analysis, we include these in 'ExportedCommands'. Changes to these type of modules will not be re-analyzed, unless the user re-imports the module, or runs Get-Module -List.
Convert a <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.SemanticVersion" /> to a <see cref="T:System.Version" />. If there is a <see cref="P:System.Management.Automation.SemanticVersion.PreReleaseLabel" /> or/and a <see cref="P:System.Management.Automation.SemanticVersion.BuildLabel" />, it is added as a NoteProperty to the result so that you can round trip back to a <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.SemanticVersion" /> without losing the label.
Looks up a localized string similar to VariableName=[VariableName] NewValue=[NewValue] PreviousValue=[PreviousValue] SequenceNumber=[SequenceNumber] HostName=[HostName] HostVersion=[HostVersion] HostId=[HostId] HostApplication=[HostApplication] EngineVersion=[EngineVersion] RunspaceId=[RunspaceId] PipelineId=[PipelineId] CommandName=[CommandName] CommandType=[CommandType] ScriptName=[ScriptName] CommandPath=[CommandPath] CommandLine=[CommandLine]
Event that is raised when a remote connection is successfully closed. The event is raised from a WSMan transport thread. Since this thread can hold on to a HTTP connection, the event handler should complete processing as fast as possible. Importantly the event handler should not generate any call that results in a user request like host.ReadLine(). Errors (occurred during connection attempt) are reported through WSManTransportErrorOccured event.
Adjusts for any variations in different protocol versions. Following changes are considered - In V2, default max envelope size is 150KB while in V3 it has been changed to 500KB. With default configuration remoting from V3 client to V2 server will break as V3 client can send upto 500KB in a single Send packet So if server version is known to be V2, we'll downgrade the max env size to 150KB (V2's default) if the current value is 500KB (V3 default)

This method is to get the unique key for a UsingExpressionAst. The key is a base64 encoded string based on the text of the UsingExpressionAst. This method is used when handling a script block that contains $using for Invoke-Command. When run Invoke-Command targeting a machine that runs PSv3 or above, we pass a dictionary to the remote end that contains the key of each UsingExpressionAst and its value. This method is used to generate the key.
This is a flavor of MethodInvokeDotNet to deal with a peculiarity of property setters: Tthe setValue is always the last parameter. This enables a parameter after a varargs or optional parameters and GetBestMethodAndArguments is not prepared for that. This method disregards the last parameter in its call to GetBestMethodAndArguments used in this case more for its "Arguments" side than for its "BestMethod" side, since there is only one method.
Encapsulates the method response semantics. Method responses are generated when RemoteHostCallPacket objects are executed. They can contain both the return values of the execution as well as exceptions that were thrown in the RemoteHostCallPacket execution. They can be encoded and decoded for transporting over the wire. A method response can be used to transport the result of an execution and then to simulate the execution on the other end.
Routine to format a usage string from keyword. The resulting string should look like: User [string] #ResourceName { UserName = [string] [ Description = [string] ] [ Disabled = [bool] ] [ Ensure = [string] { Absent | Present }  ] [ Force = [bool] ] [ FullName = [string] ] [ Password = [PSCredential] ] [ PasswordChangeNotAllowed = [bool] ] [ PasswordChangeRequired = [bool] ] [ PasswordNeverExpires = [bool] ] [ DependsOn = [string[]] ] }
True if the member should be hidden when searching with PSMemberInfoInternalCollection's Match or enumerating a collection. This should not be settable as it would make the count of hidden properties in PSMemberInfoInternalCollection invalid. For now, we are carefully setting this.isHidden before adding the members toPSObjectMembersetCollection. In the future, we might need overload for all PSMemberInfo constructors to take isHidden.
The following is the definition of the input parameter "SkipCACheck". When connecting over HTTPS, the client does not validate that the server certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). Use only when the remote computer is trusted by other means, for example, if the remote computer is part of a network that is physically secure and isolated or the remote computer is listed as a trusted host in WinRM configuration.

Class HelpInfo keeps track of help information to be returned by help system. HelpInfo includes information in following aspect, a. Name: the target name for help b. Category: what category the help belongs to This class will be derived to track help info for different help categories like, AliasHelpInfo CommandHelpInfo ProviderHelpInfo etc. In general, there will be a specific helpInfo child class for each kind of help provider.
Use Digest authentication mechanism. Digest authentication operates much like Basic authentication. However, unlike Basic authentication, Digest authentication transmits credentials across the network as a hash value, also known as a message digest. The user name and password cannot be deciphered from the hash value. Conversely, Basic authentication sends a Base 64 encoded password, essentially in clear text, across the network.
Following validation will be done, (in order) 1. If everything is empty, do default help. 2. If target is empty, set it to be provider if currently doing provider help only. Otherwise, set it to be * 3. If any special parameters like component, role, functionality are specified, do command help only. 4. If command help is requested, search for alias also. 5. If help category is none, set it to be all. 6. Don't do default help.
Event which will be triggered when the operation is complete. It is assumed that all the operations performed by StartOperation and StopOperation are asynchronous. The submitter of operations may subscribe to this event to know when it's complete (or it can handle the synchronization with its scheduler) and the throttle manager will subscribe to this event to know that it's complete and to start the operation on the next item.
When this property is set to true, DSC Cache will cache multiple versions of a resource. That means it will cache duplicate resource classes (class names for a resource in two different module versions are same). NOTE: This property should be set to false for DSC compiler related methods/functionality, such as Import-DscResource, because the Mof serializer does not support deserialization of classes with different versions.
True if the caller will guarantee that all cleanup happens as the thread unwinds. This is typically used in a case where the thread local is surrounded by a try/finally block.  The try block pushes some state, the finally block restores the previous state.  Therefore when the thread exits the thread local is back to it's original state.  This allows the ThreadLocal object to not check the current owning thread on retrieval.
Tables and Wides need to use spaces for padding to maintain table look even if console window is resized. For all other output, we use int.MaxValue if the user didn't explicitly specify a width. If we detect that int.MaxValue is used, first we try to get the current console window width. However, if we can't read that (for example, implicit remoting has no console window), we default to something reasonable: 120 columns.
Gets or sets the custom error message that is displayed to the user. The item being validated and a text representation of the validation set is passed as the first and second formatting argument to the <see cref="P:System.Management.Automation.ValidateSetAttribute.ErrorMessage" /> formatting pattern. <example><code> [ValidateSet("A","B","C", ErrorMessage="The item '{0}' is not part of the set '{1}'.") </code></example>
Private data to be used by applications built on top of PowerShell. Remote runspace gets its application private data from the server (when creating the remote runspace pool) - calling this method on a remote runspace will block until the data is received from the server. Runspaces that are part of a <see cref="P:System.Management.Automation.RemoteRunspace.RunspacePool" /> inherit application private data from the pool.
Closes an asynchronous operation; if the callback associated with the operation is pending and have not completed when WSManCloseOperation is called, then the function marks the operation for deletion and returns; If the callback was not called, the operation is cancelled and the operation callback is called with WSMAN_ERROR_OPERATION_ABORTED error; the operation handle is freed in all cases after the callback returns.
The ast that represents a parameter to a command, e.g. <c>dir -Path a*</c>, this class represent '-Path', and in <c>dir -Path:a*</c>, this class represents '-Path:a*'. In the first case, the argument 'a*' is not represented by this class because the parser can't know until runtime if the argument is positional or if -Path accepts an argument.  In the later case, the argument 'a*' always belongs to the parameter -Path.
Create an named argument, where the parameter name is known.  This can happen when: * The user uses the ':' syntax, as in foo -bar:val * Splatting, as in $x = @{ bar = val } ; foo @x * Via an API - when converting a CommandParameter to CommandParameterInternal. * In the parameter binder when it resolves a positional argument * Other random places that manually construct command processors and know their arguments.
A token that is only valid as a command name, command argument, function name, or configuration name.  It may contain characters not allowed in identifiers. Tokens with this kind are always instances of <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.Language.StringLiteralToken" /> or <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.Language.StringExpandableToken" /> if the token contains variable references or subexpressions.
In OneCore PS, there is no way to retrieve all loaded assemblies. But we have the type catalog dictionary which contains the full type names of all available CoreCLR .NET types. We can extract the necessary info from the full type names to make type name auto-completion work. This type represents a non-generic type for type name completion. It only contains information that can be inferred from the full type name.
Class HelpProviderWithFullCache provides a pseudo implementation of HelpProvider at which results are fully cached in a hashtable after initial cache load. This class is different from HelpProviderWithCache class in the sense that help contents for this provider can be loaded once and be used for later search. So logically class derived from this class only need to provide a way to load and initialize help cache.
A help file is located in 3 steps 1. If file itself contains a path itself, try to locate the file from path. LocateFile will fail if this file doesn't exist. 2. Try to locate the file from searchPaths. Normally the searchPaths will contain the cmdlet/provider assembly directory if currently we are searching help for cmdlet and providers. 3. Try to locate the file in the default PowerShell installation directory.
If HelpMessageBaseName and HelpMessageResourceId are set, the help info is loaded from the resource indicated by HelpMessageBaseName and HelpMessageResourceId. If that fails and HelpMessage is set, the help info is set to HelpMessage; otherwise, the exception that is thrown when loading the resource is thrown. If both HelpMessageBaseName and HelpMessageResourceId are not set, the help info is set to HelpMessage.
A set of assemblies that we have searched from but found no matching type. By checking this set, we can avoid searching from some assemblies multiple times. This set is made thread static, so that type resolution happens on the same thread can reuse the HashSet without having to create a new HashSet instance every time. This will reduce GC given that type resolution is a frequent operation in powershell script.
Gets and sets the default value, if any, for the implementation of <seealso cref="M:System.Management.Automation.Host.PSHostUserInterface.Prompt(System.String,System.String,System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection{System.Management.Automation.Host.FieldDescription})" /> to pre-populate its UI with. This is a PSObject instance so that the value can be serialized, converted, manipulated like any pipeline object.
Gets the Attribute classes that apply to the field. In the case that <seealso cref="M:System.Management.Automation.Host.PSHostUserInterface.Prompt(System.String,System.String,System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection{System.Management.Automation.Host.FieldDescription})" /> is being called from the MSH engine, this will contain the set of prompting attributes that are attached to a cmdlet parameter declaration.
In OneCore PS, there is no way to retrieve all loaded assemblies. But we have the type catalog dictionary which contains the full type names of all available CoreCLR .NET types. We can extract the necessary info from the full type names to make type name auto-completion work. This type represents a generic type for type name completion. It only contains information that can be inferred from the full type name.
Derived classes can override this method to provide application private data that is going to be sent to the client and exposed via <see cref="P:System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.PSSession.ApplicationPrivateData" />, <see cref="M:System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.Runspace.GetApplicationPrivateData" /> and <see cref="M:System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.RunspacePool.GetApplicationPrivateData" />
Returns an object that should be used as a key for getting 1) instance members and 2) type names - If base object is a PSCustomObject or a string or a type then the most nested wrapping PSObject is returned (the PSObject where immediateBaseObject=PSCustomObject/string/type) - Otherwise the base object is returned This is a temporary fix for Win8 : 254345 - Job Failed By Throwing ExtendedTypeSystemException.
Table of the largest safe type to which both types can be converted without exceptions. This table is used for numeric comparisons. The 4 entries marked as not used, are explicitly dealt with in NumericCompareDecimal. NumericCompareDecimal exists because doubles and singles can throw an exception when converted to decimal. The order of lines and columns cannot be changed since NumericCompare depends on it.
NeedToLogPipelineExecutionDetailEvent: check whether logging pipeline execution detail event is necessary. Whether to log command lifecycle event is controled by PSSnapin set up. Should we use session variable "LogPipelineExecutionEvent" to control this also? Currently we return true always since pipeline processor already check for whether to log logic from PSSnapin already. This may need to be changed.
Looks up a localized string similar to NewCommandState=[NewCommandState] SequenceNumber=[SequenceNumber] HostName=[HostName] HostVersion=[HostVersion] HostId=[HostId] HostApplication=[HostApplication] EngineVersion=[EngineVersion] RunspaceId=[RunspaceId] PipelineId=[PipelineId] CommandName=[CommandName] CommandType=[CommandType] ScriptName=[ScriptName] CommandPath=[CommandPath] CommandLine=[CommandLine]
A method that allows a scriptblock to be invoked with additional context in the form of a set of local functions and variables to be defined in the scriptblock's scope. The list of variables may include the special variables $input, $_ and $this. This overload of the function takes a hashtable and converts it to the required dictionary which makes the API easier to use from within a PowerShell script.
This class is designed to contains the pertinent information about a Remote Connection, such as remote computer name, remote user name etc. It is also used to access remote connection capability and configuration information. Currently the session is identified by the InstanceId of the runspacePool associated with it This can change in future if we start supporting multiple runspacePools per session.
Target object in forward-help-provider that should process this HelpInfo. This will serve as auxiliary information to be passed to forward help provider. In the case of AliasHelpInfo, for example, it needs to be forwarded to CommandHelpProvider to fill in detailed helpInfo. In that case, ForwardHelpCategory will be HelpCategory.Command and the help target is the cmdlet name that matches this alias.
The kind of block, always one of: <list type="bullet"><item><see cref="F:System.Management.Automation.Language.TokenKind.Begin" /></item><item><see cref="F:System.Management.Automation.Language.TokenKind.Process" /></item><item><see cref="F:System.Management.Automation.Language.TokenKind.End" /></item><item><see cref="F:System.Management.Automation.Language.TokenKind.Dynamicparam" /></item></list>
A short, human-presentable message to describe and identify the field.  If supplied, a typical implementation of <seealso cref="M:System.Management.Automation.Host.PSHostUserInterface.Prompt(System.String,System.String,System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection{System.Management.Automation.Host.FieldDescription})" /> will use this value instead of the field name to identify the field to the user.
INTERNAL IMPLEMENTATION CLASS It manages the finite state machine for the sequence of formatting messages. It achieves this by maintaining a stack of OutputContext-derived objects. A predefined set of events allows the host of this class to process the information as it comes trough the finite state machine (push model) IMPORTANT: The code using this class will have to provide ALL the callbacks.
Prepares the collection for a stream connect When reconnecting from same client, its possible that fragment stream get interrupted if server is dropping data When connecting from a new client, its possible to get trailing fragments of a previously partially transmitted object Logic based on this flag, ensures such offsync/trailing fragments get ignored until the next full object starts flowing.
Default scheme. As part of port DCR, WSMan changed the default ports from 80,443 to 5985,5986 respectively no-SSL,SSL connections. Since the standards say http,https use 80,443 as defaults..we came up with new mechanism to specify scheme as empty. For SSL, WSMan introduced a new SessionOption. In order to make scheme empty in the connection string passed to WSMan, we use this internal boolean.
Add common help properties to the helpObject which is in PSObject format. Intrinsic help properties include properties like, Name, Synopsis HelpCategory etc. Since help object from different help category has different format, it is needed that we generate these basic information uniformly in the help object itself. This function is normally called at the end of each child class constructor.
The type extension methods within this partial class are used/shared by both FullCLR and CoreCLR powershell. * If you want to add an extension method that will be used by both FullCLR and CoreCLR powershell, please add it here. * If you want to add an extension method that will be used only by CoreCLR powershell, please add it to the partial 'PSTypeExtensions' class in 'CorePsExtensions.cs'.
This method should handle the actual operation which need to be controlled and performed. Examples of this can be Opening remote runspace, invoking expression in a remote runspace, etc. Once an event is successfully received as a result of this function, the handler has to ensure that it raises an OperationComplete event with StartComplete or StopComplete for the throttle manager to handle.
If false, underlying WSMan infrastructure will compress data sent on the network. If true, data will not be compressed. Compression improves performance by reducing the amount of data sent on the network. Compression my require extra memory consumption and CPU usage. In cases where available memory / CPU is less, set this property to "true". By default the value of this property is "false".
Looks up a localized string similar to PowerShell cannot close the remote session properly. The session is in an undefined state because it was not opened or connected after being disconnected. PowerShell will try to force the session to close on the local computer, but the session might not be closed on the remote computer. To close a remote session properly, first open it or connect it.
If true, underlying WSMan infrastructure will compress data sent on the network. If false, data will not be compressed. Compression improves performance by reducing the amount of data sent on the network. Compression my require extra memory consumption and CPU usage. In cases where available memory / CPU is less, set this property to false. By default the value of this property is "true".
Private data to be used by applications built on top of PowerShell. Remote runspace pool gets its application private data from the server (when creating the remote runspace pool) - calling this method on a remote runspace will block until the data is received from the server. - unless the runspace is disconnected and data hasn't been received in which case it returns null immediately.
Called from <see cref="M:System.Management.Automation.WildcardPatternParser.Parse(System.Management.Automation.WildcardPattern,System.Management.Automation.WildcardPatternParser)" /> method to indicate that the bracket expression should include all characters from character range starting at <paramref name="startOfCharacterRange" /> and ending at <paramref name="endOfCharacterRange" />
The function can obtain the current mapping for a particular MS-DOS device name. If lpDeviceName is non-NULL, the function retrieves information about the particular MS-DOS device specified by lpDeviceName. The first null-terminated string stored into the buffer is the current mapping for the device. The other null-terminated strings represent undeleted prior mappings for the device.
This method should be called only from - generated ctors for PowerShell classes, AND - ScriptBlockMemberMethodWrapper when invoking static methods of PowerShell classes. It's not intended to be a public API, but because we generate type in a different assembly it has to be public. Return type should be SessionStateInternal, but it violates accessibility consistency, so we use object.
Dispose(bool disposing) executes in two distinct scenarios. If disposing equals true, the method has been called directly or indirectly by a user's code. Managed and unmanaged resources can be disposed. If disposing equals false, the method has been called by the runtime from inside the finalizer and you should not reference other objects. Only unmanaged resources can be disposed.
Session with <see cref="F:System.Management.Automation.SessionCapabilities.RemoteServer" /> capabilities can be made available on a server that wants to provide a full user experience to PowerShell clients. Clients connecting to the server will be able to use implicit remoting (Import-PSSession, Export-PSSession) as well as interactive remoting (Enter-PSSession, Exit-PSSession).
Returns PowerShell object representing the pipeline contained in this ScriptBlock, similar to the GetPowerShell() method. If the 'isTrustedInput' flag parameter is set to True, then the GetPowerShell() implementation supports extended conversion operations (such as replacing variable values with their current values) that might otherwise be unsafe if applied to untrusted input.
Gets or sets the custom error message pattern that is displayed to the user. The text representation of the object being validated and the validating regex is passed as the first and second formatting parameters to the ErrorMessage formatting pattern. <example><code> [ValidatePattern("\s+", ErrorMessage="The text '{0}' did not pass validation of regex '{1}'")] </code></example>
Looks up a localized string similar to Module '{0}' supports PowerShell edition '{1}' and cannot be loaded implicitly using the Windows Compatibility feature because it is disabled in the settings file. Use 'Import-Module -UseWindowsPowerShell' to load this module with Windows PowerShell or 'Import-Module -SkipEditionCheck' to try to load the module with the current PowerShell.
Looks up a localized string similar to {6} This error might have been caused by applying the default parameter binding. You can disable the default parameter binding in $PSDefaultParameterValues by setting $PSDefaultParameterValues["Disabled"] to be $true, and then trying again. The following default parameters were successfully bound for this cmdlet when the error occurred:{7}
Construct a module specification from a hashtable. Keys can be ModuleName, ModuleVersion, and Guid. ModuleName must be convertible to <see cref="T:System.String" />. ModuleVersion must be convertible to <see cref="P:Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.ModuleSpecification.Version" />. Guid must be convertible to <see cref="P:Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.ModuleSpecification.Guid" />.
Transport reported an error saying that uri is redirected. This method will perform the redirection to the new URI by doing the following: 1. Close the current transport manager to clean resources 2. Raise a warning that URI is getting redirected. 3. Using the new URI, ask the same transport manager to redirect Step 1 is performed here. Step2-3 is performed in another method.
This class is very similar to the restricted langauge checker, but it is meant to allow more things, yet still be considered "safe", at least in the sense that tab completion can rely on it to not do bad things.  The primary use is for intellisense where you don't want to run arbitrary code, but you do want to know the values of various expressions so you can get the members.
Help request is a set of data to be passed into monad help engine for requesting help contents. Help request track information including 1. target 2. category filter 3. provider 4. dynamic parameters 5. components 6. functionalities 7. roles Upon getting a help request, help engine will validate the help request and send the request to necessary help providers for processing.
Existing Key = HKCU and HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShell\1\ShellIds\Microsoft.PowerShell Proposed value = Existing default execution policy if not already specified Schema: { "shell-ID-string:ExecutionPolicy" : "execution policy string" } TODO: In a single config file, it might be better to nest this. It is unnecessary complexity until a need arises for more nested values.
Checks to see if the module manifest contains the specified key. If it does and it can be converted to the expected type, then it returns <c>true</c> and sets <paramref name="result" /> to the value. If the key is missing it returns <c>true</c> and sets <paramref name="result" /> to <c>default(<typeparam name="T" />)</c>. If the key is invalid then it returns <c>false</c>.
This cmdlet enters into an interactive session with the specified local process by creating a remote runspace to the process and pushing it on the current PSHost. If the selected process does not contain PowerShell then an error message will result. If the current user does not have sufficient privileges to attach to the selected process then an error message will result.
If the cmdlet declares paging support (via <see cref="P:System.Management.Automation.CmdletCommonMetadataAttribute.SupportsPaging" />), then <see cref="P:System.Management.Automation.PSCmdlet.PagingParameters" /> property contains arguments of the paging parameters. Otherwise <see cref="P:System.Management.Automation.PSCmdlet.PagingParameters" /> property is <c>null</c>.
ExternalErrorOutput provides asynchronous access to the combined error output of all commands in the pipeline except what is routed to other commands in the pipeline.  Note that if ExternalErrorOutput is specified, the errorResults return parameter to SynchronousExecute will always be empty.  PipelineProcessor will close ExternalErrorOutput when the pipeline is finished.
Called by a cmdlet to confirm the operation with the user.  Cmdlets which make changes (e.g. delete files, stop services etc.) should call ShouldProcess to give the user the opportunity to confirm that the operation should actually be performed. This variant allows the caller to specify the complete text describing the operation, rather than just the name and action.
This class performs the fragmentation as well as defragmentation operations of large objects to be sent to the other side. A large remoting PSObject will be broken into fragments. Each fragment has a ObjectId and a FragmentId. The last fragment also has an end of fragment marker. These fragments can be reassembled on the receiving end by sequencing the fragment ids.
A non-empty collection of command elements represent the content of the DynamicKeyword. It may represents a command, such as “Import-DSCResource”, or DSC resources, then CommandElements includes: (1) Keyword Name (2) InstanceName (3) Body, could be ScriptBlockExpressionAst (for Node keyword) or a HashtableAst (remaining) This property is never null and never empty.
Reports error from a thread pool thread. Thread Pool is used in order to not block Pipeline closing. This method is generally called when the TransportManager fails to Send data (SendDataToClient). Pipeline Execution Thread directly calls SendDataToClient method from its execution thread, so we cannot call Stop from the same thread (as it will result in a deadlock)
When connecting over HTTPS, the client does not validate that the server certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). Use only when the remote computer is trusted by other means, for example, if the remote computer is part of a network that is physically secure and isolated or the remote computer is listed as a trusted host in WinRM configuration.
When the "shape" of formatting has been determined by previous objects, sometimes you want objects of different types to continue using that shape (table, list, or whatever) even if they specify their own views, and sometimes you want your view to take over. When OutOfBand is true, the view will apply regardless of previous objects that may have selected the shape.
Looks up a localized string similar to DetailSequence=[DetailSequence] DetailTotal=[DetailTotal] SequenceNumber=[SequenceNumber] UserId=[User] HostName=[HostName] HostVersion=[HostVersion] HostId=[HostId] HostApplication=[HostApplication] EngineVersion=[EngineVersion] RunspaceId=[RunspaceId] PipelineId=[PipelineId] ScriptName=[ScriptName] CommandLine=[CommandLine]
Initializes static members of the <see cref="T:Microsoft.PowerShell.Telemetry.ApplicationInsightsTelemetry" /> class. Static constructor determines whether telemetry is to be sent, and then sets the telemetry key and set the telemetry delivery mode. Creates the session ID and initializes the HashSet of known module names. Gets or constructs the unique identifier.
Replaces any existing metadata in this object with the metadata specified. Note that this method should NOT be called after a MergedCommandParameterMetadata instance is made read only by calling MakeReadOnly(). This is because MakeReadOnly() will turn 'bindableParameters', 'aliasedParameters' and 'parameterSetMap' into ReadOnlyDictionary and ReadOnlyCollection.
Contains a pipeline and calls InvokeAsync on the pipeline on StartOperation. On StopOperation it calls StopAsync. The handler sends a StopComplete message in OperationComplete for both the functions. This is because, there is only a single state of the pipeline which raises an event on a method call. There are no separate events raised as part of method calls.
Int - max SOAP envelope size (kb) - default 150kb from winrm config (see 'winrm help config' for more details); the client SOAP packet size cannot surpass this value; this value will be also sent to the server in the SOAP request as a MaxEnvelopeSize header; the server will use min(MaxEnvelopeSizeKb from server configuration, MaxEnvelopeSize value from SOAP).
Looks up a localized string similar to {6} This failure might be caused by applying the default parameter binding. You can disable the default parameter binding in $PSDefaultParameterValues by setting $PSDefaultParameterValues["Disabled"] to be $true, and retry. The following default parameter was successfully bound for this cmdlet when the error occurred:{7}
Base class providing support for string manipulation. This class is a tear off class provided by the LineOutput class Assumptions (in addition to the assumptions made for LineOutput): - characters map to one or more character cells NOTE: we provide a base class that is valid for devices that have a 1:1 mapping between a UNICODE character and a display cell.
Private data to be used by applications built on top of PowerShell. Local runspace pool is created with application private data set to an empty <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.PSPrimitiveDictionary" />. Runspaces that are part of a <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.RunspacePool" /> inherit application private data from the pool.
Looks up a localized string similar to The {0} cmdlet defines the {1} parameter set more than once.  Verify that the Cmdlet Definition XML does not have duplicate parameter set names and retry. {StrContains="CmdletParameterSet"} {0} is a placeholder for a cmdlet name. Example: 'Get-Win32Process' {1} is a placeholder for a parameter set name.  Example: 'foo'
Send on-idle event if the engine is idle. The property "AutoReset" of the timer is always false, so only one handler will be running at anytime. The timer will be enabled again if we can meet the following two conditions. 1. No PowerShell.OnIdle event is sent out 2. A PowerShell.OnIdle event is sent out, and there are still subscribers to the on-idle event.
Process any pending actions. The parser calls this method before it executes any parse tree node. If we are processing pending actions, we must block the parser. To prevent starvation of the foreground script, we throttle the number of events that we process while the parser is waiting. If the parser is not waiting, we do not throttle the event processing.
The alternate path separator used by the base implementation of the providers. Porting note: we do not use .NET's AlternatePathSeparatorChar here because it correctly states that both the default and alternate are '/' on Linux. However, for PowerShell to be "slash agnostic", we need to use the assumption that a '\' is the alternate path separator on Linux.
Get the substituted path of a NetWork type MS-DOS device that is created by 'subst' command. When a MS-DOS device is of NetWork type, it could be: 1. Substitute a path in a drive that maps to a network location. For example: net use z: \\scratch2\scratch\ subst y: z:\abc\ 2. Substitute a network location directly. For example: subst y: \\scratch2\scratch\
Generate a PowerShell event. <param name="sourceIdentifier"> An optional identifier that identifies the source event </param><param name="sender"> The object that generated this event </param><param name="args"> Any event-specific data associated with the event. </param><param name="extraData"> Any additional data you wish to attach to the event </param>
Looks up a localized string similar to Cannot process argument because the value of parameter "{0}" is not valid. Valid values are "Global", "Local", or "Script", or a number relative to the current scope (0 through the number of scopes where 0 is the current scope and 1 is its parent). Change the value of the "{0}" parameter and run the operation again.
The ast that represents a constant string expression that is always constant.  This includes both single and double quoted strings, but the double quoted strings will not be scanned for variable references and sub-expressions. If expansion of the string is required, use <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.Language.ExpandableStringExpressionAst" />.
The method performs the fragmentation operation. All fragments of the same object have the same ObjectId. All fragments of the same object have the same ObjectId. Each fragment has its own Fragment Id. Fragment Id always starts from zero (0), and increments sequentially with an increment of 1. The last fragment is indicated by an End of Fragment marker.
Creates a PowerShell event. <param name="sourceIdentifier"> An optional identifier that identifies the source event </param><param name="sender"> The object that generated this event </param><param name="args"> Any event-specific data associated with the event. </param><param name="extraData"> Any additional data you wish to attach to the event </param>
This overload exists so that we can remove items based on the item name, rather than its position in the collection. The type argument can be null but we'll throw an error if we can't distinguish between multiple entries of the same name but different types and the type hasn't been specified. BUGBUG - brucepay - the throw thing is not implemented yet...
Looks up a localized string similar to The PrivateData parameter value must be a hash table to create the module manifest with the following parameter values Tags, ProjectUri, LicenseUri, IconUri or ReleaseNotes. Either remove the Tags, ProjectUri, LicenseUri, IconUri, or ReleaseNotes parameter values or wrap the contents of PrivateData in a hashtable.
Compile a pipeline as an element in a pipeline chain. Needed since pure expressions won't set $? after them. <seealso cref="M:System.Management.Automation.Language.Compiler.CompileTrappableExpression(System.Collections.Generic.List{System.Linq.Expressions.Expression},System.Management.Automation.Language.StatementAst)" /> which does something similar.
Looks up a localized string similar to When RunAs is enabled in a PowerShell session configuration, the Windows security model cannot enforce a security boundary between different user sessions that are created by using this endpoint. Verify that the PowerShell runspace configuration is restricted to only the necessary set of cmdlets and capabilities.
Looks up a localized string similar to Cannot process the ObjectModelWrapper attribute. The {0} type defines multiple parameter sets. Verify that the Cmdlet Definition XML specifies a valid type in the ObjectModelWrapper attribute and retry. {StrContains="ObjectModelWrapper"} {0} is a placeholder for a .NET class name.  Example: System.Net.IPAddress
Looks up a localized string similar to An error occurred while decoding data received from the remote computer. At least {0} bytes of data are required to decode a deserialized object that is received from a remote computer. This can happen if the fragments are not properly constructed by the remote computer, or if the data was corrupted or changed.
Creates a label with a Hotkey from <paramref name="parameterName" />. The Hotkey is <paramref name="parameterName" />'s first capital character not in <paramref name="usedHotKeys" />. If <paramref name="parameterName" /> does not have any capital character, the first lower case character is used. The Hotkey is preceded by an ampersand in the label.
The Activity, Reason, TargetName and TargetType strings in ErrorCategoryInfo can be of unlimited length.  In order to control the maximum length of the GetMessage() string, we ellipsize these strings.  The current heuristic is to take strings longer than 40 characters and ellipsize them to the first and last 19 characters plus "..." in the middle.
Some classes that implement IEnumerable are not considered as enumerable from the perspective of pipelines, this binder implements those semantics. The standard interop ConvertBinder is used to allow third party dynamic objects to get the first chance at the conversion in case they do support enumeration, but do not implement IEnumerable directly.
This is the downstream object recipient.  If this is set, Add() and AddItems() write to this recipient instead of to the internal queue.  This also disables the DownstreamCmdlet. <remarks> It is improper to change this once the pipeline has started executing, although the checks for this are in the PipelineProcessor class and not here. </remarks>
Confirm the operation with the user.  Cmdlets which make changes (e.g. delete files, stop services etc.) should call ShouldProcess to give the user the opportunity to confirm that the operation should actually be performed. This variant allows the caller to specify the complete text describing the operation, rather than just the name and action.
Looks up a localized string similar to The PrivateData should be defined as a hashtable, but this module manifest defines it as an object. Please consider wrapping the contents of PrivateData in a hashtable. This will enable you to add the Tags, ProjectUri, LicenseUri, IconUri, and ReleaseNotes properties to the module manifest at a later time.
Looks up a localized string similar to The WriteObject and WriteError methods cannot be called from outside the overrides of the BeginProcessing, ProcessRecord, and EndProcessing methods, and they can only be called from within the same thread. Validate that the cmdlet makes these calls correctly, or contact Microsoft Customer Support Services.
A simple forth-style stack machine for executing Expression trees without the need to compile to IL and then invoke the JIT.  This trades off much faster compilation time for a slower execution performance. For code that is only run a small number of times this can be a sweet spot. The core loop in the interpreter is the RunInstructions method.
Monad internal implementation of the ICommandRuntime2 interface used for execution in the monad engine environment. There will be one instance of this class for each cmdlet added to a pipeline. When the cmdlet calls its WriteObject API, that API will call the WriteObject implementation in this class which, in turn, calls the downstream cmdlet.
For most scopes (global scope being the notable exception), most variables are known ahead of time and stored in a tuple.  The names of those variables are stored separately, this method determines if variable name is active in this scope, and if so, returns a wrapper around the tuple to access the property in the tuple for the given variable.
Looks up a localized string similar to Cannot run the pipeline because the first cmdlet in the pipeline is trying to read input from the results of a preceding cmdlet. Either modify the first cmdlet, remove the first cmdlet, or add to the pipeline the cmdlet whose output is required by the first cmdlet, and then try running the pipeline again.
Event raised when RunspacePoolInitInfo is received. This is the first runspace pool message expected after connecting to an existing remote runspace pool. RemoteRunspacePoolInternal should use this notification to set the state of a reconstructed runspace to "Opened State" and use the minRunspace and MaxRunspaces information to set its state.
This is queue of all the state change event which have occured for this runspace. RaiseRunspaceStateEvents raises event for each item in this queue. We don't raise events from with SetRunspaceState because SetRunspaceState is often called from with in the a lock. Raising event with in a lock introduces chances of deadlock in GUI applications.
The asts representing a pair of (condition,statements) that are tested, in sequence until the first condition tests true, in which case it's statements are executed, otherwise the <see cref="P:System.Management.Automation.Language.IfStatementAst.ElseClause" />, if any, is executed.  This property is never null and always has at least 1 value.
Looks up a localized string similar to Cannot process the ObjectModelWrapper attribute. The {0} type is an open generic type.  Verify that the Cmdlet Definition XML specifies a valid type in the ObjectModelWrapper attribute and retry. {StrContains="ObjectModelWrapper"} {0} is a placeholder for a .NET class name.  Example: System.Net.IPAddress
Ordinarily, the collection checks/converts the value (by applying the attribute) when an attribute is added.  This is both slow and wrong when the attributes have already been checked/applied during parameter binding.  So if checking has already been done, this function will add the attribute without checking and possibly updating the value.
When true and in loopback scenario (localhost) this enables creation of WSMan host process with the user interactive token, allowing PowerShell script network access, i.e., allows going off box.  When this property is true and a PSSession is disconnected, reconnection is allowed only if reconnecting from a PowerShell session on the same box.
When set and in loopback scenario (localhost) this enables creation of WSMan host process with the user interactive token, allowing PowerShell script network access, i.e., allows going off box.  When this property is true and a PSSession is disconnected, reconnection is allowed only if reconnecting from a PowerShell session on the same box.
Binds the specified argument to the specified parameter using the appropriate parameter binder. If the argument is of type ScriptBlock and the parameter takes pipeline input, then the ScriptBlock is saved off in the delay-bind ScriptBlock container for further processing of pipeline input and is not bound as the argument to the parameter.
This is used for script commands (i.e. _isScript is true). If _useLocalScope is true, script is run in LocalScope.  If null, it was unspecified and a suitable default is used (true for non-script, false for script).  Note that the public property is bool, not bool? (from V1), so it should probably be deprecated, at least for internal use.
This is the upstream external object source.  If this is set, Retrieve() will attempt to read objects from the upstream source before indicating that the pipe is empty. <remarks> It is improper to change this once the pipeline has started executing, although the checks for this are in the PipelineProcessor class and not here. </remarks>
Clone this InitialSessionState object. The collections are recursively cloned as well as the elements in the collections. Note however, that the contents of the individual entries are not deep-cloned. This is only an issue for variable entries which may have reference types. These objects will be added by reference rather than by value.
Looks up a localized string similar to Cannot retrieve dynamic parameters for the cmdlet. Dynamic parameter '{1}' specified parameter set '{6}' which was not statically defined for this cmdlet. New parameter sets may not be defined as dynamic parameters, although dynamic parameters may join parameter sets which were statically defined.
LogEngineHealthEvent: Log an engine health event. If engine state is changed, a engine lifecycle event will be logged also. This is the basic form of EngineHealthEvent logging api, in which all parameters are provided. Variant form of this function is defined below, which will make parameters additionalInfo and newEngineState optional.
Called by a cmdlet to confirm the operation with the user.  Cmdlets which make changes (e.g. delete files, stop services etc.) should call ShouldProcess to give the user the opportunity to confirm that the operation should actually be performed. This variant allows the caller to specify text for both the target resource and the action.
Creates a new instance of the PSEventJob class. <param name="eventManager"> The event manager that controls the event subscriptions </param><param name="subscriber"> The subscriber that generates these actions </param><param name="action"> The script block invoked for this event </param><param name="name"> The name of the job </param>
This does not ensure that the corresponding session/runspacepool is in connected stated Its the caller responsiblity to ensure that this is the case At the protocols layers, this logic is delegated to the transport layer. WSMan transport ensures that WinRS commands cannot be reconnected when the parent shell is not in connected state.
Event that is raised when a remote object is available. The event is raised from a WSMan transport thread. Since this thread can hold on to a HTTP connection, the event handler should complete processing as fast as possible. Importantly the event handler should not generate any call that results in a user request like host.ReadLine().
The ast that represents an array literal expression, e.g. <c>1,2,3</c>.  An array expression, e.g. <c>@(dir)</c>, is represented by <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.Language.ArrayExpressionAst" />.  An array literal expression can be constructed from a single element, as happens with the unary comma operator, e.g. <c>,4</c>.
When a temporary pipe is used in the middle of execution, then we need to pass along the error and warning variable list to hold the errors and warnings get written out while the temporary pipe is being used. We don't need to pass along the out variable list because we don't care about the output generated in the middle of execution.
Indicates whether the data collection should have a blocking enumerator by default. Currently only when a PowerShell object is associated with the data collection, a reference count is added which causes the enumerator to be blocking. This prevents the use of PSDataCollection without a PowerShell object. This property fixes the same.
Provides a description of a choice for use by <seealso cref="M:System.Management.Automation.Host.PSHostUserInterface.PromptForChoice(System.String,System.String,System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection{System.Management.Automation.Host.ChoiceDescription},System.Int32)" />. <!--Used by the Msh engine to describe cmdlet parameters.-->
Looks up a localized string similar to Could not parse visible command definition for '{0}'. The visible command definition must be a hashtable with the keys of 'Name' and 'Parameters'. The value of the 'Parameters' key must be a collection of hashtables with the keys 'Name', and optionally either 'ValidateSet' or 'ValidatePattern'.
Looks up a localized string similar to Get-Help cannot find the Help files for this cmdlet on this computer. It is displaying only partial help. -- To download and install Help files for the module that includes this cmdlet, use Update-Help. -- To view the Help topic for this cmdlet online, type: "Get-Help {0} -Online" or go to {1}.
Specify a default value and/or help comment for a command parameter.  This attribute does not have any semantic meaning, it is simply an aid to tools to make it simpler to know the true default value of a command parameter (which may or may not have any correlation with, e.g., the backing store of the Parameter's property or field.
The duration for which PowerShell remoting waits before timing out on a connection to a remote machine. Simply put, the timeout for a remote runspace creation. The user would like to tweak this timeout depending on whether he/she is connecting to a machine in the data center or across a slow WAN. Default: 3 * 60 * 1000 = 3 minutes.
Convert an definitionListItem node into an PSObject For example <definitionListItem><term> term text </term><definition><para> definition text </para></definition></definitionListItem> In this case, an PSObject of type "definitionListText" will be created with following properties a. term="term text" b. definition="definition text"
Looks up a localized string similar to A command that prompts the user failed because the host program or the command type does not support user interaction. Try a host program that supports user interaction, such as the PowerShell Console, and remove prompt-related commands from command types that do not support user interaction.
This is needed to deserialize objects coming from the network. This may be null..in which case type rehydration does not happen. At construction time we may not have typetable (server runspace is created only when a request from the client)..so this is a property on the base transport manager to allow for setting at a later time.
Returns an instance of BaseChannelWriter. If the Etw is not supported by the platform it will return NullWriter.Instance A Task and a set of Keywords can be specified in the GetTraceSource method (See overloads). The supplied task and keywords are used to pass to the Etw provider in case they are not defined in the manifest file.
Looks up a localized string similar to The job operation (Create, Get, or Remove) could not be performed because the JobSourceAdapter type specified in the JobDefinition is not registered. Register the JobSourceAdapter type either by using an explicit call, or by calling the Import-Module cmdlet, and then specifying an assembly.
<para> Encapsulates $PSVersionTable. </para><para> Provides a simple interface to retrieve details from the PowerShell version table: <code> PSVersionInfo.PSVersion; </code> The above statement retrieves the PowerShell version. <code> PSVersionInfo.PSEdition; </code> The above statement retrieves the PowerShell edition. </para>
Looks up a localized string similar to An error has occurred while loading script module {0} because it has a different language mode than the module manifest. The manifest language mode is {1} and the module language mode is {2}. Ensure all module files are signed or otherwise part of your application allow list configuration.
This is queue of all the state change event which have occured for this pipeline. RaisePipelineStateEvents raises event for each item in this queue. We don't raise the event with in SetPipelineState because often SetPipelineState is called with in a lock. Raising event in lock introduces chances of deadlock in GUI applications.
When executing a scriptblock, the command origin needs to be set for the current scope. If this true, then the scope origin will be set to the command origin. If it's false, then the scope origin will be set to Internal. This allows public functions to call private functions but still see $MyInvocation.CommandOrigin as $true.
This class contains information about the capability of one side of the connection. The client side and the server side will have their own capabilities. These two sets of capabilities will be used in a capability negotiation algorithm to determine if it is possible to establish a connection between the client and the server.
Looks up a localized string similar to The specified IdleTimeout session option {0} (seconds) is not a valid period.  Specify an IdleTimeout value that is greater than or equal to the minimum allowed {1} (seconds). {0} is a placeholder for the provided idletimeout {1} is a placeholder for the minimum allowed idletimeout value
Collect values for UsingExpressions, in the form of a dictionary and an array. - The dictionary form is used when the remote server is PSv5 and later version for handling UsingExpression in Invoke-Command/Start-Job - The array form is used when the remote server is PSv3 and PSv4 for handling UsingExpression in Invoke-Command.
Queries the server for disconnected runspace pools and creates an array of runspace pool objects associated with each disconnected runspace pool on the server.  Each runspace pool object in the returned array is in the Disconnected state and can be connected to the server by calling the Connect() method on the runspace pool.
<see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.PSPrimitiveDictionary" /> is a <see cref="T:System.Collections.Hashtable" /> that is limited to 1) case-insensitive strings as keys and 2) values that can be serialized and deserialized during PowerShell remoting handshake (in major-version compatible versions of PowerShell remoting)
For WSMan sessions: If this parameter is not specified then the value specified in the environment variable DEFAULTREMOTESHELLNAME will be used. If this is not set as well, then Microsoft.PowerShell is used. For VM/Container sessions: If this parameter is not specified then all sessions that match other filters are returned.
Escapes content so that it is safe for inclusion in a string that will later be used as a format string. If this is to be embedded inside of a single-quoted string, be sure to also call EscapeSingleQuotedStringContent. For example: "'" + EscapeSingleQuotedStringContent(EscapeFormatStringContent(userContent)) + "'" -f $args.
Looks up a localized string similar to {0} {1} This is a resource string, to support locales where the order of placeholders might need to be reversed. {0} is a placeholder for a top-level exception message (i.e. "There is an error in XML document (2, 2).") {1} is a placeholder for a secondary exception message (i.e. "")
This is need for the state change events that resulted in closing the underlying datastructure handler. We cannot send the state back to the upper layers until close is completed from the datastructure/transport layer. We have to send the terminal state only when we know that underlying datastructure/transport is closed.
PinvokeDllNames contains the DLL names to be use for PInvoke in FullCLR/CoreCLR powershell. * When adding a new DLL name here, make sure that you add both the FullCLR and CoreCLR version of it. Add the comment '/*COUNT*/' with the new DLL name, and make sure the 'COUNT' is the same for both FullCLR and CoreCLR DLL names.
A PrimaryRunspace is a runspace that persists for the entire lifetime of the PowerShell session. It is only closed or disposed when the session is ending.  So when the PrimaryRunspace is closing it will trigger on-exit cleanup that includes closing any other local runspaces left open, and will allow the process to exit.
Allows internal nested commands to be run as "HostInNestedPrompt" so that CreatePipelineProcessor() does not set CommandOrigin to Internal as it normally does by default.  This then allows cmdlets like Invoke-History to replay history command lines in the current runspace with the same language mode context as the host.
Test hook used to test implicit remoting batching.  A local runspace must be provided that has imported a remote session, i.e., has run the Import-PSSession cmdlet.  This hook will return true if the provided commandPipeline is successfully batched and run in the remote session, and false if it is rejected for batching.
An implementation of semantic versioning (https://semver.org) that can be converted to/from <see cref="T:System.Version" />. When converting to <see cref="T:System.Version" />, a PSNoteProperty is added to the instance to store the semantic version label so that it can be recovered when creating a new SemanticVersion.
It can have the following values: 0 : ignore greater than 0 : it represents the indentation for the first line (i.e. "first line indent"). The first line will be indented by the indicated number of characters. less than 0 : it represents the hanging of the first line WRT the following ones (i.e. "first line hanging").
Return all of the expressions assigned by the assignment statement.  Typically it's just a variable expression, but if <see cref="P:System.Management.Automation.Language.AssignmentStatementAst.Left" /> is an <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.Language.ArrayLiteralAst" />, then all of the elements are assigned.
This method is called when the user sends a stop signal to the cmdlet. The cmdlet will not exit until it has completed creating all the runspaces (basically the runspaces its waiting on OpenAsync is made available). However, when a stop signal is sent, CloseAsyn needs to be called to close all the pending runspaces.
Represents an unbound parameter object in the engine. It's similar to AutomationNull.Value however AutomationNull.Value as a parameter value is used to say "use the default value for this object" whereas UnboundParameter says "this parameter is unbound, use the default only if the target type supports permits this."
Invoked by <see cref="M:System.Management.Automation.Cmdlet.WriteInformation(System.Management.Automation.InformationRecord)" /> to give the host a chance to intercept informational messages. These should not be displayed to the user by default, but may be useful to display in a separate area of the user interface.
Looks up a localized string similar to The data in the command exceeded the maximum size that is allowed by the session configuration. The allowed maximum is {0} MB. Change the input, use a different session configuration, or change the "{1}" and "{2}" properties of the session configuration on the remote computer.
This abstract class defines the server side data structure handler that a remote connection has at the remote session level. There are two other data structure handler levels: 1) at the runspace level, 2) at the pipeline level. This session level data structure handler defines what can be done at the session level.
ExternalSuccessOutput provides asynchronous access to the success output of the last command in the pipeline.  Note that if ExternalSuccessOutput is specified, the result array return value to SynchronousExecute will always be empty.  PipelineProcessor will close ExternalSuccessOutput when the pipeline is finished.
Confirm the operation with the user.  Cmdlets which make changes (e.g. delete files, stop services etc.) should call ShouldProcess to give the user the opportunity to confirm that the operation should actually be performed. This variant allows the caller to specify text for both the target resource and the action.
This attribute is used for Design For Testability. It should be placed on any method containing code which is likely to be sensitive to X86/X64/IA64 issues, primarily code which calls DllImports or otherwise uses NativeMethods.  This allows us to generate code coverage data specific to architecture sensitive code.
Constructs a disconnected child job that is able to connect to a remote runspace/command on a server.  The ExecutionCmdletHelperRunspace must contain a remote pipeline object in a disconnected state.  In addition the pipeline runspace must be associated with a valid running remote command that can be connected to.
This is the thread on which NestedPipeline can be executed. In case of LocalPipeline, this is the thread of execution of LocalPipeline. In case of RemotePipeline, this is thread on which EnterNestedPrompt is called. RemotePipeline proxy should set it on at the beginning of EnterNestedPrompt and clear it on return.
Set a variable in session state. This interface supports the "namespace:name" syntax so you can do things like "$env:PATH = 'c:\windows'" or "$global:foobar = 13" BUGBUG: this overload exists because a lot of tests in the testsuite use it. Those tests should eventually be fixed and this overload should be removed.
Looks up a localized string similar to The names of some imported commands from the module '{0}' include unapproved verbs that might make them less discoverable. To find the commands with unapproved verbs, run the Import-Module command again with the Verbose parameter. For a list of approved verbs, type Get-Verb.
Process data coming from the transport. This method analyses the data and if an object can be created, it creates one and calls the <paramref name="callback" /> with the deserialized object. This method does not assume all fragments to be available. So if not enough fragments are available it will simply return..
The duration (in ms) for which PowerShell remoting waits before timing out on a connection to a remote machine. Simply put, the timeout for a remote runspace creation. The administrator would like to tweak this timeout depending on whether he/she is connecting to a machine in the data center or across a slow WAN.
The duration for which a Runspace on server needs to wait before it declares the client dead and closes itself down. This is especially important as these values may have to be configured differently for enterprise administration and exchange scenarios. Default: -1 -&gt; Use current server value for IdleTimeout.
Gets or sets the custom error message that is displayed to the user. The item being validated and the validating scriptblock is passed as the first and second formatting argument. <example><code> [ValidateScript("$_ % 2", ErrorMessage = "The item '{0}' did not pass validation of script '{1}'")] </code></example>
Check whether a HelpItems node indicates that the help content is authored using maml schema. This covers two cases: a. If the help file has an extension .maml. b. If HelpItems node (which should be the top node of any command help file) has an attribute "schema" with value "maml", its content is in maml schema.
Calculate the widths by applying some heuristics to get them to fit on the allotted table width. It first assigns widths to the columns that do not have a specified width, then it checks if the total width exceeds the screen widths. If so, it proceeds with column elimination, starting from the right most column.
Looks up a localized string similar to Unable to parse the expression due to an unexpected token. An identifier name or a NOT (!) operator is expected at the start of the expression, or after an OR (,) operator or an AND (+) operator. Also, an expression must not end with an OR (,), AND (+) or NOT (!) operator.
This routine starts the stepping process. It is optional to call this but can be useful if you want the begin clauses of the pipeline to be run even when there may not be any input to process as is the case for I/O redirection into a file. We still want the file opened, even if there was nothing to write to it.
Combines RequireGroups logic operator hash tables / lists e.g., -RequiredGroups @{ Or = 'TrustedGroup1', 'MFAGroup2' } -RequiredGroups @{ And = 'Administrators', @{ Or = 'MFAGroup1', 'MFAGroup2' } } -RequiredGroups @{ Or = @{ And = 'Administrators', 'TrustedGroup1' }, @{ And = 'Power Users', 'TrustedGroup1' } }
Looks up a localized string similar to Module {0} is loaded in Windows PowerShell using {1} remoting session; please note that all input and output of commands from this module will be deserialized objects. If you want to load this module into PowerShell Core please use 'Import-Module -SkipEditionCheck' syntax.
Starts named pipe server listening thread.  When a client connects this thread makes a callback to implement the client communication.  When the thread ends this object is disposed and a new RemoteSessionNamedPipeServer must be created and a new listening thread started to handle subsequent client connections.
Looks up a localized string similar to This runspace pool {0} is not configured to provide disconnected PowerShell objects for commands running on the remote server.  Use the RunspacePool class GetRunspacePools() static method to query the server and return runspace pool objects that are configured to do this.
This defines the default behavior for the WriteError method. If it is true, a call to this method will result in an immediate call to the command WriteError method, or to the writeErrorDelegate if one has been supplied. If it is false, the objects will be accumulated until the GetErrorObjects method is called.
The precedence of comparison operators including: '-eq', '-ne', '-ge', '-gt', '-lt', '-le', '-like', '-notlike', '-match', '-notmatch', '-replace', '-contains', '-notcontains', '-in', '-notin', '-split', '-join', '-is', '-isnot', '-as', and all of the case sensitive variants of these operators, if they exists.
This data type is used when an Exception derived from IContainsErrorRecord is caught on server and is sent to client. This exception gets serialized as an error record. On the client this data type is deserialized in to an ErrorRecord. ErrorRecord on the client has an instance of RemoteException as exception.
Looks up a localized string similar to Access is denied. The command could not update Help topics for the PowerShell core modules, or for any modules in the $pshome\Modules directory. To update these Help topics, start PowerShell by using the "Run as Administrator" command, and try running Update-Help again.
Ensures the namedpipe singleton server is running and waits for a client connection. This is a blocking call that returns after the client connection ends. This method supports PowerShell running in "NamedPipeServerMode", which is used for PowerShell Direct Windows Server Container connection and management.
Provides a description of a field for use by <see cref="M:System.Management.Automation.Host.PSHostUserInterface.Prompt(System.String,System.String,System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection{System.Management.Automation.Host.FieldDescription})" />. <!--Used by the Msh engine to describe cmdlet parameters.-->
This class contains information about the debugging capability of the server side of the MS-PSRDP connection. The functionality that is supported is determined by the PowerShell version on the server. These capabilities will be used in remote debugging sessions to determine what is supported by the server.
Looks up a localized string similar to The setter method should be public, void, static, and have two parameters. The first parameter should be of the type PSObject. A second parameter is required if a getter method is also available, and should have the same type as the return type for the getter method.
Looks up a localized string similar to The contents of file {0} might have been changed by an unauthorized user or process, because the hash of the file does not match the hash stored in the digital signature. The script cannot run on the specified system. For more information, run Get-Help about_Signing.
Handler for handling runspace state changed events. This method will be registered in the StartOperation and StopOperation methods. This handler will in turn invoke the OperationComplete event for all events that are necessary - Opened, Closed, Disconnected, Broken. It will ignore all other state changes.
Clears the session history based on the input parameter <param name="id">Id of the entry to be cleared.</param><param name="count">Count of entries to be cleared.</param><param name="cmdline">Cmdline string to be cleared.</param><param name="newest">Order of the entries.</param><returns>Nothing.</returns>
This function is created to PreProcess -NestedModules in Win8. In Win7, -NestedModules is of type string[]. In Win8, we changed this to object[] to support module specification using hashtable. To be backward compatible, this function calls ToString() on any object that is not of type hashtable or string.
Starts connecting to remote end asynchronously. This will result in a WSManCreateShellEx WSMan async call. By the time this call returns, we will have a valid handle, if the operation succeeds. Make sure other methods are called only after this method returns. Thread synchronization is left to the caller.
Looks up a localized string similar to There is no Runspace available to get and run the SteppablePipeline in this thread. You can provide one in the DefaultRunspace property of the System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.Runspace type. The script block you attempted to get SteppablePipeline from was: {0}
Looks up a localized string similar to The script '{0}' cannot be run because it contains a "#requires" statement for running as Administrator. The current PowerShell session is not running as Administrator. Start PowerShell by using the Run as Administrator option, and then try running the script again.
Adds an additional statement for execution For example, <code> Runspace rs = RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspace(); PowerShell ps = PowerShell.Create(); ps.Runspace = rs; ps.AddCommand("Get-Process").AddArgument("idle"); ps.AddStatement().AddCommand("Get-Service").AddArgument("audiosrv"); ps.Invoke(); </code>
Looks up a localized string similar to A Using variable cannot be retrieved. A Using variable can be used only with Invoke-Command, Start-Job, or InlineScript in the script workflow. When it is used with Invoke-Command, the Using variable is valid only if the script block is invoked on a remote computer.
Looks up a localized string similar to Cannot load the module '{0}' because the module nesting limit has been exceeded. Modules can only be nested to {1} levels. Evaluate and change the order in which you are loading modules to prevent exceeding the nesting limit, and then try running your script again.
The help object builder class attempts to create a full HelpInfo object from a CmdletInfo object. This is used to generate the default UX when no help content is present in the box. This class mimics the exact same structure as that of a MAML node, so that the default UX does not introduce regressions.
Looks up a localized string similar to This cmdlet supports the common parameters: Verbose, Debug, ErrorAction, ErrorVariable, WarningAction, WarningVariable, OutBuffer, PipelineVariable, and OutVariable. For more information, see about_CommonParameters (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).
To make it easier to specify -ConfigurationData parameter, we add an ArgumentTransformationAttribute here. When the input data is of type string and is valid path to a file that can be converted to hashtable, we do the conversion and return the converted value. Otherwise, we just return the input data.
Gets the aggregated list of visible commands exported from the module. If there are two commands of different types exported with the same name (e.g. alias 'foo' and cmdlet 'foo') the combined dictionary will only contain the highest precedence cmdlet (e.g. the alias 'foo' since aliases shadow cmdlets.
Used by callers to prepare the session transportmanager for a URI redirection. This must be called only after Create callback (or Error form create) is received. This will close the internal WSMan Session handle. Callers must catch the close completed event and call Redirect to perform the redirection.
Sometimes a valid ast is parsed successfully within the extent that this error expression represents.  Those asts are contained in this collection.  This collection may contain other error asts.  This collection may be null when no asts were successfully constructed within the extent of this error ast.
Called by the engine to notify the host that it is about to execute a "legacy" command line application.  A legacy application is defined as a console-mode executable that may do one or more of the following: . reads from stdin . writes to stdout . writes to stderr . uses any of the win32 console APIs.
Suppresses forwarding of job output into a cmdlet (like Receive-Job). This flag modifies functionality of <see cref="M:System.Management.Automation.Job.WriteObject(System.Object)" /> method, so that it doesnt add output-processing to <see cref="P:System.Management.Automation.Job.Results" /> collection.
Looks up a localized string similar to You have entered a session that is busy running a command or script.  Because output is routed to job "{0}", you will not see output in the console.  You can wait for the running command to finish, or cancel the command and get an input prompt by pressing Ctrl-C.
Split a given string into its user and domain components. Supported formats are: -- domain\user -- user@domain With any other format, the entire input is treated as user name and domain is set to "". In any case, the function does not check if the split string are really valid as user or domain names.
Sometimes a valid ast is parsed successfully within the extent that this error statement represents.  Those asts are contained in this collection.  This collection may contain other error asts.  This collection may be null when no asts were successfully constructed within the extent of this error ast.
Looks up a localized string similar to The {0} ActionPreference value is reserved for future use and is not supported at this time. It has been replaced in your {1} variable by the default value of {2}. For more information about preference variables, see the Help topic, "about_Preference_Variables."
Queries the server for disconnected runspaces and creates an array of runspace objects associated with each disconnected runspace on the server.  Each runspace object in the returned array is in the Disconnected state and can be connected to the server by calling the Connect() method on the runspace.
Create a wildcard pattern based on a target. Here we provide the default implementation of this, covering following two cases a. if target has wildcard pattern, return as it is. b. if target doesn't have wildcard pattern, postfix it with * Child class of this one may choose to override this function.
Retrieve the parent process of a process. Previously this code used WMI, but WMI is causing a CPU spike whenever the query gets called as it results in tzres.dll and tzres.mui.dll being loaded into every process to convert the time information to local format. For perf reasons, we resort to P/Invoke.
Combines <see cref="M:Microsoft.PowerShell.Cmdletization.CmdletAdapter`1.ProcessRecord(Microsoft.PowerShell.Cmdletization.QueryBuilder)" /> and <see cref="M:Microsoft.PowerShell.Cmdletization.CmdletAdapter`1.ProcessRecord(`0,Microsoft.PowerShell.Cmdletization.MethodInvocationInfo,System.Boolean)" />.
Looks up a localized string similar to A script or application on the remote computer {0} is sending a prompt request. When you are prompted, enter sensitive information, such as credentials or passwords, only if you trust the remote computer and the application or script that is requesting the data.
Looks up a localized string similar to Run only scripts that you trust. While scripts from the internet can be useful, this script can potentially harm your computer. If you trust this script, use the Unblock-File cmdlet to allow the script to run without this warning message. Do you want to run {0}?
Looks up a localized string similar to An error occurred while loading Help content for {0} from file {1}. Details: {2}. To download updated Help topics, run the Update-Help cmdlet. To get help online, search for the Help topic in the TechNet library at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=107116.
The assemblies this script requires, specified like: <code>#requires -Assembly path\to\foo.dll</code><code>#requires -Assembly "System.Management.Automation, Version=3.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35"</code> If no assemblies are required, this property is an empty collection.
Looks up a localized string similar to Greater than or equal to - case insensitive.

Return whether the Runspace is Remote We can determine this by whether the runspace is an implementation of LocalRunspace or infer it from whether the ConnectionInfo property is null If it happens to be an instance of a LocalRunspace, but has a non-null ConnectionInfo we declare it to be remote.
Turn off compression for Send/Receive operations.  By default compression is turned on, but if communicating with a down-level box it may be necessary to do this.  Other reasons for turning it off is due to the extra memory consumption and CPU utilization that is used as a result of compression.
Used by hosting applications to notify PowerShell engine that it is being hosted in a console based application and the Pipeline execution thread should call SetThreadUILanguage(0). This property is currently used by ConsoleHost only and in future releases we may consider exposing this publicly.
Creates an <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.InitialSessionState" /> instance that exposes only the minimal set of commands needed by give set of <paramref name="sessionCapabilities" />. All commands that are not needed are made private in order to minimize the attack surface.
If script execution is currently in debugger stopped mode, this will release the debugger and terminate script execution, or if processing a debug command will stop the debug command. This is used to implement the remote stop signal and ensures a command will stop even when in debug stop mode.
Looks up a localized string similar to Running the Get-Module cmdlet against a remote computer can only be done for module names that do not include a path. Name parameter has this element '{0}' which resolves to a path. Update the Name parameter to not have path elements, and then try again.
Check the list of running hashes for any matches, but only up to the limit of <paramref name="upTo" />. If a hash matches, we ignore the possibility of a collision. If the hash is acceptable, collisions will be infrequent and we'll just log an occasionaly script that isn't really suspicious.

Looks up a localized string similar to Regular expression matching operator - case insensitive. When the left operand is a collection, returns values from the collection that do not match the right hand operand, otherwise returns TRUE if the left operand does not match the right operand.
Initializes a new instance of PSMemberSet with all the initial members in <paramref name="members" />. This constructor is supposed to be used in TypeTable to reuse the passed-in member collection. Null-argument check is skipped here, so callers need to check arguments before passing in.
Gets and sets the current operation of the many required to accomplish the activity (such as "copying foo.txt"). Normally displayed below its associated progress bar, e.g., "deleting file foo.bar" Set to null or empty in the case a sub-activity will be used to show the current operation.
Reconnects a previously disconnected commandTM. Implemented by WSMan transport Note that there is not explicit disconnect on commandTM. It is implicity disconnected when disconnect is called on sessionTM . The TM's also dont maintain specific connection state This is done by DSHandlers.
Gets and sets the estimate of time remaining until this activity is completed.  This can be based upon a measurement of time since started and the percent complete or another approach deemed appropriate by the caller. Normally displayed beside the progress bar, as "N seconds remaining."
Fix for BUG: Windows Out Of Band Releases: 906263 and 906264 The interpreter prompt CommandBaseStrings:InquireHalt should be suppressed when this flag is set.  This will be set when this prompt has already occurred and Break was chosen, or for ActionPreferenceStopException in all cases.

This is for simplifying property value array of only one element. As mentioned in comments for GetInsideProperties, this is needed to reduce an array of only one PSObject into the PSObject itself. A side effect of this function is to turn property values from ArrayList into PSObject[].
When specified on a property or field of a DSC Resource, the property can or must be specified in a configuration, unless it is marked <see cref="P:System.Management.Automation.DscPropertyAttribute.NotConfigurable" />, in which case it is returned by the Get() method of the resource.
Return the binding restriction that tests that an instance member does not exist, used when the binder knows instance members might exist (because the name was added to some instance), but the object we're currently binding does not have an instance member with the given member name.
If <c>true</c> then Operating System won't load the user profile (i.e. registry keys under HKCU) on the remote server which can result in a faster session creation time.  This option won't have any effect if the remote machine has already loaded the profile (i.e. in another session).
An object stream using a PSDataCollection as the object store. This stream lets user to supply a custom PSDataCollection instance to use as the stream's object store. This stream is designed to be used with the user supplied PSDataBuffers. For internal only purposes use ObjectStream.
Determines whether objects should be sent to API consumers. This command is automatically added to the pipeline when PowerShell is transcribing and invoked via API. This ensures that the objects pass through the formatting and output system, but can still make it to the API consumer.
To make it easier to specify -Encoding parameter, we add an ArgumentTransformationAttribute here. When the input data is of type string and is valid to be converted to System.Text.Encoding, we do the conversion and return the converted value. Otherwise, we just return the input data.
Looks up a localized string similar to Could not convert the value of the '{0}' role entry to a hashtable. The 'Roles' entry must be a hashtable with group names for keys, where the value associated with each key is another hashtable of session configuration properties for that role.

Tries to get a value that might be present in a chain of nested PSPrimitiveDictionaries. For example to get $sessionInfo.ApplicationPrivateData.ImplicitRemoting.Hash you could call TryPathGet&lt;string&gt;($sessionInfo.ApplicationPrivateData, out myHash, "ImplicitRemoting", "Hash").
Looks up a localized string similar to Multiple versions of the module '{0}' were found. You can run 'Get-Module -ListAvailable -FullyQualifiedName {0}' to see available versions on the system, and then use the fully qualified name '@{{ModuleName="{0}"; RequiredVersion="Version"}}'.
Utility routine to kill a process, discarding non-critical exceptions. This utility makes two passes at killing a process. In the first pass, if the process handle is invalid (as seems to be the case with an ntvdm) then we try to get a fresh handle based on the original process id.
Receive/send operation handles and callback handles should be released/disposed from receive/send callback only. Releasing them after CloseOperation() may not cover all the scenarios, as WSMan does not guarantee that a rcv/send callback is not called after Close completed callback.
Gets and sets the value that will serve as a replacement to the return of the GetValue method of <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.PSObjectPropertyDescriptor" />. If this property is not set to a value other than null then the exception associated with this event is thrown.

Resolves using module to a collection of PSModuleInfos. Doesn't throw. PSModuleInfo objects are returned in the right order: i.e. if multiply versions of the module is presented on the system and user didn't specify version, we will return all of them, but newer one would go first.
This event handler is after the command lookup is done but before the event object is returned to the caller. This allows things like interning scripts to work. If should have a single string parameter that is the name of the command and should return a CommandInfo object or null.
For any unbound parameters, this method checks to see if the parameter has a default value specified, and evaluates the expression (if the expression is not constant) and binds the result to the parameter. If not, we bind null to the parameter (which may go through type coercion).
The purpose of this class is to hide an object (mask it) and replace it with a substitute temporarily. This is used in pushing and popping runspaces. It is also used to temporarily set a PowerShell object's host as the Runspace object's host when the PowerShell object is executed.
Managed representation of WSMAN_OPERATION_INFO. selectorSet and optionSet are handled differently because they are structs that contain pointers to arrays of structs. Most other data structures in the API point to structures using IntPtr rather than including the actual structure.
Stops the writer from writing anything to the stream. This is used by session transport manager when the server process is exited but the session data structure handlers are not notified yet. So while the data structure handler is disposing we should not let anyone use the stream.
Helper method to handle PSComputerName and PSShowComputerName properties from the formating objects. If PSShowComputerName exists and is false, removes PSComputerName from the display. PSShowComputerName is an internal property..so this property is always removed from the display.

Defines the Action Preference options.  These options determine what will happen when a particular type of event occurs. For example, setting shell variable ErrorActionPreference to "Stop" will cause the command to stop when an otherwise non-terminating error occurs.
Currently initialization is done in following sequence a. Try to load CrimsonLogProvider (in the case of Longhorn) b. If a fails, use the DummyLogProvider instead. (in low-level OS) In the longer turn, we may need to use a "Provider Catalog" for log provider loading.
PSv2CompletionCompleter implements the algorithm we use to complete cmdlet/file names in PowerShell v2. This class exists for legacy purpose only. It is used only in a remote interactive session from Win8 to Win7. V3 and forward uses completely different completers.
This allows all success output to be set to a variable.  Similar to the way -errorvariable sets all errors to a variable name.  Semantically this is equivalent to :  cmd |set-var varname -passthru but it should be MUCH faster as there is no binding that takes place.
Looks up a localized string similar to Cannot load certificate. The identifier '{0}' matches multiple certificates. To encrypt to multiple recipients, provide multiple specific values to the '{1}' parameter, rather than a wildcard that matches multiple certificates.
There might be many cast operators in a Type A that take Type A. Each operator will have a different return type. Because of that we cannot call GetMethod since it would cause a AmbiguousMatchException. This auxiliary method calls GetMember to find the right method.
